 *
 * ⚠️ THE AUDIT WRITE AND THE FINAL TELEMETRY LINK ARE NOT TRANSACTIONAL, AND CANNOT BE HERE.
 * lib/db.ts exports `sql` as a Proxy with only an `apply` trap over a bare function target, so the
 * driver's own `transaction` method is not reachable — and even if it were, it could not span the
 * application logic between the audit insert and the telemetry link. What replaces atomicity is
 * stated rather than assumed: idempotent updates, an explicit revision guard, and a reconciler.
 * Nothing in this module claims atomicity, and the build report declares this as a declaration.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING MUTATES IN PLACE. Every write returns an UPDATED handle. A caller holding a stale
 * handle is rejected by the revision guard rather than silently overwriting a newer result.
