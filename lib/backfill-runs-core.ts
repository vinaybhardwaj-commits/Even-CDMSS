 * 'active'` was written back over `'stopped'` and the run resumed on the next cron fire. The operator
 * pressed stop, the console showed stopped, and the run kept spending.
 *
 * THE RULE. A TICK MAY ONLY EVER MOVE A RUN THAT IS STILL ACTIVE. An operator action (stop, pause)
 * is a statement about the future and the tick's status decision was computed from a past that no
 * longer holds; between a stale intention and a fresh instruction, the instruction wins. This applies
 * to EVERY status write a tick makes — the cursor advance, the day/run completion, and the error
 * paths — because each of them is the same stale write.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS *NOT* CONDITIONAL: the work that actually happened. Progress counters, tokens, cost, the
 * cursor and `last_error` are recorded regardless. Those notes WERE graded and stored; a run that
 * dropped them on being stopped would under-report real spend and could re-grade the same day on
 * resume. Accounting records the past, status records the intent, and only the second is contested.
 *
 * Enforced twice, as one fact in two places: here for the decision, and in the SQL itself
