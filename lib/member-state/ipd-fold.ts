/**
 * lib/member-state/ipd-fold.ts — the P4 fold's IMPURE half: the identity hop, and the read that
 * turns a member's stay libraries into `kind: 'ipd'` encounters
 * (CDMSS-CASE-AGENTS-SPINE-PRD-v1.0-27-AUG-2026, §6.4, D14 / O12).
 *
 * O12 puts the hop "at fold/read time in lib/member-state/member-state.ts (or a tiny sibling in the
 * same directory)". This is that sibling, so member-state.ts gains a flag branch and nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠️ IDENTITY IS THE DANGEROUS PART, AND IT FAILS CLOSED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.
 *
 * `ipd_discharge_audits.member_id` (which P2 copied to `clinical_states.member_uid`) is a FIRESTORE
 * member document id. It is NOT an `individual_uid`, and MemberState's `memberRef` is an
 * `individual_uid`. Getting this wrong does not produce a missing fact — it produces one member's
 * operation on another member's spine, which is the worst failure this programme can have. So:
 *
 *   · The hop resolves through the MEASURED path this repo already trusts: a stay's UHIDs against
 *     `individuals.kx_uhid` / `old_kx_uhids`, narrowed in SQL and then RE-VERIFIED by exact
 *     membership in JS (lib/readmission/db13.ts's `resolveIndividualUid`, measured 46/46 on the
 *     readmission form records). The SQL only narrows; JS decides.
 *   · A member_uid is NEVER treated as an individual_uid, and there is no code path that could:
 *     the fold takes the member_uid only to FIND the stays and passes it nowhere near `memberRef`.
 *   · MORE THAN ONE resolved individual is a REFUSAL, not a choice. A household shares a member
 *     account; picking one would be the household collapse D14 forbids. Zero is also a refusal.
 *   · A stay whose identity does not resolve to exactly one individual is SKIPPED. Its
 *     ClinicalState rows stay in the library — P2 already persisted them — and nothing folds.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO EVEN ACCOUNT NUMBER ON NEON, NO individual_uid IN A PROMPT. This file reads db13 and writes
 * nothing. The `individual_uid` it resolves is returned to the caller in memory; it is never stored
 * on a Neon table and never reaches model material.
 *
 * ⚠️ INFERRED SQL: this sandbox has no live DB. Every query used here is listed verbatim in the P4
 * report, and every path fail-closes to "no fold" rather than to a guess.
