/**
 * lib/member-state/ipd-evidence.ts — the P4 fold's PURE half: one stay's ClinicalState library →
 * one `kind: 'ipd'` EncounterEvidence, and the trust gate that decides what is allowed through
 * (CDMSS-CASE-AGENTS-SPINE-PRD-v1.0-27-AUG-2026, §6.2 / §6.3, D6 / D12 / D13).
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE WRITE (D6, §6.4). "Write" means: build ONE EncounterEvidence, append it after
 * the frozen assemble, then let frozen `buildMemberState` project. This file produces input and
 * nothing else — it never patches a snapshot array, and it cannot: it returns evidence, not a
 * snapshot. Sibling to care-call-evidence.ts by design, which does the same job for the CCB loop.
 *
 * THE GATE IS THE POINT. A spine write is not reverted by a code revert — a wrong fact promoted
 * onto a member's longitudinal record is there until someone finds it. So `promotable` is a pure
 * function with five conjunctive conditions and a NAMED refusal reason for each, and every default
 * is refusal:
 *   1. the slot is on the §6.2 allow-list                      (nothing else has a promote path)
 *   2. provenance.trust ∈ { structured_db, clinician_documented }
 *   3. an LLM-extracted fact must carry a VERIFIED verbatim span in its named source field
 *   4. `inferred` is absent or false                            (D12: inferred NEVER promotes)
 *   5. the caller resolved a SINGLE individual_uid              (checked by the caller, asserted here)
 *
 * WHAT CONDITION 3 ACTUALLY CHECKS, stated plainly because it is easy to make vacuous. The rule is
 * that `rawText` occurs verbatim in the text of the field the provenance NAMES. That text must be
 * SUPPLIED by the caller. A caller that cannot supply it does not get a pass — the fact fails
 * closed. This is why a P2 discharge procedure, whose extractor kept no span into the PDF, usually
 * does not promote, and why an OT `surgery_name` (deterministic, so condition 3 does not apply) does.
 *
 * REFUSED, ALWAYS (§6.5): situations, NQI / CVI / PDQI / bands / LVC / Hide, disposition, LOS,
 * admission type, completeness holes, mesh or implant as a device, a surgery title as a problem
 * without an Even code, an intra-op invented from a missing OT, a PROM-path fold. None of them has a
 * branch here; the allow-list is a closed set and a test enumerates it.
 *
 * PURE: no DB, no model, no clock, no I/O. Imports nothing the frozen-spine tripwires forbid —
 * architecture rules 6, 7 and 8 guard the IPD audit module, the admission-window projection and the
 * compose-outside adapter respectively, and acceptance #13 additionally requires that the second of
 * those names appears nowhere in this directory AT ALL, comments included. Hence this paraphrase:
 * a tripwire that a file can trip by DESCRIBING what it refuses to import is a tripwire worth
 * keeping strict, so the text is worked around rather than the test loosened.
