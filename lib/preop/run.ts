/**
 * lib/preop/run.ts — the deterministic ₹0 sweep: detect episodes, assemble inputs,
 * recompute snapshots, write through the versions rail (PRD §6; Build Plan B2).
 *
 * THERE IS NO MODEL IN THIS FILE, and there is none anywhere below it. Every tick is
 * SQL plus the pure cores. The extraction and narrative rails (PRD §7) attach at B5/B6
 * behind their own flags; with those flags off — which is how Slice 1 ships — this
 * sweep IS the whole engine, degraded in coverage and correct in behaviour.
 *
 * Sweep-is-the-retry, the readmissions posture: nothing is queued and nothing is
 * marked failed. A source that faulted this tick simply did not observe anything, the
 * affected instrument widened to a range and said so on the card, and the next tick
 * tries again. The only thing a fault can cost is an input.
 *
 * The clock enters here, ONCE, and is passed down as arguments — `todayIst` and
 * `computedAt`. Everything below this line is pure.
