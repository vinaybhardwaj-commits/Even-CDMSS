EVIDENCE LEDGER:
${renderEvidence(catalog)}
Source 4 — OT / PAC / progress items ([OTn], [PACn], [Pn]) are the teams' contemporaneous notes from db13: index-stay items carry the same interest as the index summary; readmit-stay items are the other admission's record (disinterested). A template that is absent from the ledger is UNKNOWN, never "uneventful" — do not infer a clean intra-op course from silence.

TASKS:
1. planned — was this return intended BEFORE the index discharge? Planned counts ONLY if foreshadowed in the INDEX summary (written before the outcome). Intent asserted only in the readmit note does NOT count.
2. same_condition — same failing physiology or a genuinely different illness? Decide on the failing-organ analyte bundle (renal = creatinine+BUN+potassium; cardiac = BNP+weight+sodium; hepatic = bilirubin+INR+ammonia), NOT the diagnosis strings, which a coder can rename.
3. omissions — every stability claim in the index summary that a lab value contradicts (e.g. "stable at discharge" beside potassium 2.9). Rank by clinical danger. If the lab-timing profile is admission_only, say so — an admission abnormality expected to correct is weaker evidence.
4. exculpatory_claims — every claim that excuses the readmission ("non-adherent", "against medical advice", "justified re-presentation") with whatever DISINTERESTED evidence corroborates it. No corroboration → empty corroborating_evidence_ids.
5. avoidable — on the evidence, did this readmission need to happen? avoidable = the index care or discharge decision set it up; justified = the return was clinically necessary and not attributable to the index care.
6. weakest_step — name the single weakest inferential step in your own reasoning.
7. refusal_record — evidence you looked for and could not find.
