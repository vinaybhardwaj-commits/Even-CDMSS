/**
 * lib/discharge-extract-store.ts — the SHARED de-identified extracted-case store
 * (Phase 1.5 substrate addendum §5, decision 7.1).
 *
 * ONE extraction, two readers. The IPD discharge audit reads every filed discharge
 * PDF on its cron and now writes the de-identified `ExtractedCase` here (an additive,
 * best-effort persistence write — lib/ipd-audit/run.ts). The readmission agent reads
 * from here first and only extracts a document itself when the store has no row,
 * writing it back. That is the whole point of 7.1: no duplicate Gemini reads, and one
 * extraction shared across both features.
 *
 * PHI POSTURE (§5a, V-approved). The row holds the de-identified `ExtractedCase` —
 * clinical content the extractor produced from a de-identified read, with patient name
 * and UHID already stripped (the extractor never emits them; `rawNotes` is
 * de-identified by construction). `document_id`/`ip_uid`/`member_id` are LINK-BACK
 * keys — re-identification metadata, never sent to a model — the same posture as the
 * `ipd_discharge_audits` row. This is a DELIBERATE expansion of what the IPD audit
 * persists (today it keeps the audit report, not the raw extract) and it is approved.
 * Content sits in Neon under the existing BAA + Tokyo residency posture.
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE, ABSOLUTELY. Every writer returns 'skipped' and every reader returns null
 * on any DB fault (including "the migration has not run yet"). Nothing here throws.
 * The IPD audit calls the writer from inside its own success path, so a store fault
 * must never be able to turn an audit that already ran into a failure.

/**
 * The shared extraction version. Bump ONLY when the extractor's output shape or the
 * extract prompt changes in a way that makes an old row unusable — the upsert key is
 * (document_id, extraction_version), so a bump re-extracts rather than overwriting,
 * and both readers move together.
 *
 * doc-extract/1 → doc-extract/2 (R10-A, 28 Aug 2026; PRD R10-D2). `verbatim_sections` was added
 * to the extract contract, so a doc-extract/1 row is not merely thinner — it CANNOT answer the
 * question R10 asks of it ("does this document print an operative block?"). Reading one as if it
 * could would reproduce the exact defect R10 fixes: silence read as absence.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE BUMP COSTS BOTH READERS, ON PURPOSE. The store is shared with the IPD discharge audit
 * (lib/ipd-audit/run.ts), so its next read of any document also finds no row at doc-extract/2 and
 * re-extracts. That is the price of one shared extraction and it is the same price the store's own
 * doc comment names; the readmission backfill (POST /api/admin/readmission-reextract) pays it up
 * front for the ~190 documents the readmission cohort actually needs, and every other document is
 * re-read lazily, once, by whichever reader gets there first.
