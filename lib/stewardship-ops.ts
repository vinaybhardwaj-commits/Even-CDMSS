/**
 * lib/stewardship-ops.ts — the consult-ops pane's db13 reads
 * (CDMSS-STEWARDSHIP-MS-AGENT-KICKOFF-v2-29-AUG-2026, A4 / A7–A10; spec §4 D-ops-*).
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * CARD 8747 IS NEVER FETCHED. It is a dated extract with a hardcoded Jun 01 – Sep 01 2026 IST
 * window and a third literal date inside its TC block, last edited 2026-08-20. Polling it returns a
 * frozen quarter. Every metric below is rebuilt as live SQL against the same db13 tables, from the
 * dictionary in `handoff-docs/CDMSS-CONSULTS-OPS-DICTIONARY-8747-EVIDENCE-29-AUG-2026.md`, with the
 * card's own measured traps corrected rather than copied.
 *
 * WHAT THE DICTIONARY MEASURED AND THIS FILE DOES DIFFERENTLY, each with the reason:
 *
 *   · `is_no_show` is null on 92% of rows and TRUE on 3 CANCELED and 6 DOCTOR_NO_SHOW rows, so it
 *     conflates three outcomes. Patient no-show is `status = 'NO_SHOW'` (A9).
 *   · Doctor no-show is `status = 'DOCTOR_NO_SHOW'` — NEW WORK, not a reconstruction: card 8747
 *     computes no such thing, and the surface labels it as new.
 *   · The cancelling actor comes from the LAST `history` element, not from `cancelled_by`, which is
 *     populated on 561 of 2,689 cancelled rows.
 *   · TC identification is the resolved join URL, not the blank facility name (A4). The two disagree
 *     on 3 rows in 30d, and the URL keys on the actual Meet artefact.
 *   · CSAT averages RATED rows only. The card's `ELSE 0` maps 74% of latest-feedback rows — the
 *     unrated ones — to a score of zero, and zero is not a rating (A8).
 *   · `rating__submitted_at` is TEXT, so the card's recency ordering is a lexical string sort that
 *     works only while every row shares one format. It is cast here.
 *   · The TC on-time patient side drops its `LIKE '%gmail.com'` filter (A10), which silently
 *     discarded 496 distinct non-gmail patients and 688 measurable consults in 30d.
 *   · `chart_financial_reporting__services` is DEDUPED per `calendar_uid` before any join: 59
 *     calendar_uids carry 2–5 rows and the card multiplies on them.
 *
 * THE THREE DECK-BASIS REPLICAS (A7 / A8 / A10) are computed HERE, live, from the same tables, in
 * the same query as their primary. They exist for reconciliation with the existing slides and for
 * nothing else: they sort nothing, they feed no standing, and the type makes them a field of the
 * primary so neither can be rendered alone.
 *
 * WAIT is the 28 Aug method (`handoff-docs/OPD-REAL-WAIT-METHOD-28-AUG-2026.md`), not slot lead time
 * and not check-in-to-Rx: same-calendar-day token open → CONSULTATION `called_at`. Previous-day
 * stamps are DROPPED and counted, because Chart copies yesterday's booking onto today's check-in on
 * roughly a quarter of rows and those "waits" are 10–120 hours of lead time.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️ INFERRED SQL THROUGHOUT — no live DB in this sandbox. Every string is exported verbatim in
 * `OPS_INFERRED_SQL`. `metabaseQuery` takes NO bind parameters, so the window is inlined as an
 * integer literal built from a code constant, never from user input. Every read is fail-safe: a
 * fault leaves that metric UNKNOWN (an em-dash), never zero.
