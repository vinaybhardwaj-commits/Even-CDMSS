/**
 * lib/case-ask/stewardship-material.ts — the stewardship room's half of the shared case-Ask shell
 * (CDMSS-STEWARDSHIP-MS-AGENT-KICKOFF-v2-29-AUG-2026, A2 / A3 / A6; spec §6.1–§6.2).
 *
 * A2 says it in one line: "One new material builder in one new file … for the physician and dept
 * cases." Everything else the box does — the citation gate, the caps, the IST daily ceiling, the
 * de-identification fence, the withheld-turn discipline, the Opus pin with no ladder — already
 * exists once in lib/case-ask-core.ts and lib/case-ask/{ask,serve,store}.ts and is NOT re-specified,
 * re-implemented or forked here. This file answers exactly one question: given a physician or a
 * department, what has the system already stored about them that an answer may cite?
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THESE TWO CASES, and why it is worth saying out loud: `opd` and `ipd` are
 * ONE audited artefact. `physician` and `dept` are a 90-DAY AGGREGATE over many. The fence is
 * unchanged in kind but stricter in effect — an aggregate crosses many patients, so nothing
 * patient-level may enter it at all. What the model sees here is counts, means, rates and finding
 * SUBJECTS. It never sees a note, a stay, a uid, a date of service, or one patient's anything.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS FILE MAY NOT DO. It reads. It never writes. No score, no band, no verdict, no
 * pill, no `physician_standing` — S4 owns the overlay and it is not built here. The turns are stored
 * by the route through lib/case-ask/store.ts, as on every other surface.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE IPD LEG IS ABSENT FROM THE PHYSICIAN CASE, BY DECISION, NOT BY OMISSION (A1 / D-identity).
 * `opd_note_audits.doctor_uid` and the IPD treating consultant are not the same key on this spine.
 * S3 will join what a practitioner id resolves; until it lands, the physician material says so in
 * its own words rather than presenting an OPD-only record as a whole one. The DEPARTMENT case can
 * carry an inpatient reading today, because a department needs no doctor hop — `ipd_speciality` is
 * its own vocabulary and its own case key (A3), never merged with the OPD one.
 *
 * ⚠️ INFERRED SQL THROUGHOUT: this sandbox has no live Neon. Every query below is listed verbatim in
 * the S1 slice report for validation. Every read is fail-safe — a fault degrades that part of the
 * material to nothing with an honest gap line, never a 500 and never a guessed number.
