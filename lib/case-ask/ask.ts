/**
 * lib/case-ask/ask.ts — the IMPURE half of the shared case Ask shell
 * (CDMSS-CASE-AGENTS-SPINE-PRD-v1.0-27-AUG-2026, P1 / §3): the case MATERIAL assembled from the
 * audit row's STORED artefacts, and ONE Opus-4.6-on-Bedrock call whose answer is checked by code
 * (caseAskVerdict) before anything is returned. Called by the two admin ask routes; never from a
 * page render.
 *
 * ⚠️ Not named in the PRD §7 P1 file list, which names `lib/case-ask/store.ts` and the routes. It
 * exists for the reason lib/readmission/ask.ts exists on the readmission side: a route should not
 * hold a model call, a trace, a cost reconciliation and a citation verdict. Everything here sits
 * inside the `lib/case-ask/` family the contract created, and it imports no readmission file (O3).
 *
 * THE FENCE (§3.1 / §3.3): no re-audit, no regeneration, no db13 / Metabase / PDF read. The material
 * is built from columns the audit already wrote, so it is de-identified by construction — this file
 * never reads a name, a UHID, an encounter id, a document id or an individual_uid, and never passes
 * one to the model.
 *
 * THIS FILE WRITES NOTHING. The turns are stored by the route through lib/case-ask/store.ts, and
 * there is no score, verdict or feedback write anywhere on this path (§3.3).
