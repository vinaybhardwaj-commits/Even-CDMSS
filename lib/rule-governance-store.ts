/**
 * lib/rule-governance-store.ts — R3-A: the Even rule book, IO layer (Neon). DORMANT.
 *
 * NOTHING IMPORTS THIS except its own two admin routes (kickoff §4 proof 1). It is gated on
 * LVC_RULE_GOVERNANCE_ENABLED === '1' (S3), which ships UNSET. No cron, no build hook, no deploy
 * step, no worker reaches it. IT DOES NOT RUN ITSELF (the refusal sentence from
 * app/api/admin/migrate-lvc-wording/route.ts:15, copied deliberately).
 *
 * NO LLM. No prompt is issued or registered here (kickoff §6 trap 7).
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY SQL STRING IN THIS FILE IS INFERRED — the builder's sandbox has no live DB. Each one is
 * reproduced verbatim in the build report, and the orchestrator validates it against live Neon
 * before this module is merged, let alone enabled.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES (kickoff §5, and the four dormancy proofs pin it):
 *   · `lvc_recommendations` is NEVER written — no INSERT, no UPDATE, no DELETE, no ALTER, no new
 *     status value, no new row. Six of its eleven readers do not filter `status`, so a new value
 *     or row silently changes the note page, both provenance-tier reads, the MCP dedup gate,
 *     lvc_gaps and the wording readback (kickoff §6 trap 1). Governance state lives ENTIRELY in
 *     the new tables — the boundary migration 0023 already drew for proposals. The ONE statement
 *     here that names the table at all is the bootstrap SELECT, which reads and returns nothing.
 *   · no audit-suppression table, no `approved_by='admin'` row (S5 — that removal is its own patch)
 *   · no lvp_* table, no score column, no engine version.
 *
 * ATOMICITY (O2). Neon's HTTP driver has no interactive BEGIN/COMMIT: one statement IS one
 * transaction. Every governance write is therefore ONE data-modifying-CTE statement — the
 * lib/readmission/store.ts:203-210 pattern — so proposal state, the immutable version row and the
 * pattern mapping all land together or none of them do. There is no ordered-degradation path and
 * no second `await run(...)` inside any write function; a test asserts that.

 * ── D2 §1.4 (Saul Rep 48): three constraints on the pattern↔rule bridge ─────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ WRITTEN HERE AND NOT AS `--` COMMENTS INSIDE THE DDL STRING. `rule-governance-migration.test.ts`
 * compares the reference `.sql` against these constants statement-for-statement, and it strips
 * comment lines from the `.sql` side ONLY. A comment inside the template literal therefore appears
 * on one side and not the other and breaks parity — which it did, first try. The executable string
 * stays exactly what executes; the reasoning lives out here.
 *
 * `rule_pattern_map_pattern_unique` — ONE ROW PER PATTERN. Not merely hygiene: it is the conflict
 * target §1.3's claim-first CTE uses. Without it `ON CONFLICT (lvp_pattern_id)` has nothing to
 * name, and the atomic identity claim cannot serialise at all. The two are one mechanism.
 *
 * `rule_pattern_map_snapshot_identity` — the frozen snapshot must be a snapshot OF THIS PATTERN.
 * Otherwise a row can carry the identity of one pattern and the evidence of another, and the
 * evidence is the entire point of freezing: a snapshot describing a different pattern is not
 * replayable, and nothing downstream could detect the substitution.
 *
 * `rule_pattern_map_pattern_id_form` — the identity is DERIVED from the concept, and the derivation
 * is fixed: `patternIdFor()` in lib/lvp-core.ts returns `'pattern:' + concept_id`. Pinned so a row
 * cannot claim an identity the shelf could never have produced.
 *
 * ⚠️ A BLANK OR ABSENT `concept_id` FAILS IT RATHER THAN DEFAULTING, and that is written out
 * explicitly. `->>` yields SQL NULL for an absent key, and a CHECK is SATISFIED by NULL — so an
 * absent concept_id would have passed a naive equality test. The presence and nonblank guards are

 * `WHERE NOT EXISTS (… lower(p.statement) = lower($1))`. That rule compared BOILERPLATE AGAINST
 * BOILERPLATE — the wrapper prose around two genuinely different patterns is nearly identical, so
 * it could block a legitimate second pattern while doing nothing to stop two concurrent writes of
 * the SAME pattern. It is removed as the authoritative rule.
 *
 * The identity is now claimed FIRST, atomically, on `lvp_pattern_id`:
 *
 *   claim → prop → ver
 *
 * Each downstream CTE selects FROM the one above it, so a request whose `claim` returns zero rows
 * writes zero rows EVERYWHERE — no proposal, no version, no map row. That is the whole mechanism
 * for "a concurrent losing request must write zero rows", and it needs no advisory lock and no
 * second statement: it is still ONE data-modifying CTE, and one statement is one transaction on
 * Neon's HTTP driver.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE MAP CAN LEAD, VERIFIED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. `rule_pattern_map` has NO foreign key to
 * `lvc_rule_versions` — checked directly in migration 0039, which declares no foreign keys on this
 * table at all — and its `rule_ref` is CALLER-MINTED, arriving as a parameter rather than being
 * produced by the version insert. So nothing about the map row depends on the version row existing
 * first. Had a foreign key existed, this order would have been impossible and the instruction was
 * to stop and report rather than reach for a second statement.
 *
 * ⚠️ `ON CONFLICT (lvp_pattern_id) DO NOTHING` REQUIRES THE UNIQUE CONSTRAINT added in §1.4. The
 * two are one mechanism, not two independent hardenings: without the constraint there is no
 * conflict target to name and this statement does not compile against the schema.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PROPOSAL IS STILL WRITTEN, and still `proposed`. Containment of the legacy ratify path is
 * §1.1's job in lib/mcp-tools.ts, not this statement's — a bridge proposal continues to exist and
 * is simply no longer ratifiable through the legacy tool.

/**
 * Snapshot every existing registry rule's CURRENT definition into lvc_rule_versions as
 * `bootstrap_snapshot`, version 1.
 *
 * THIS IS NEVER A RETROACTIVE RATIFICATION (§3.8). A bootstrap row records what a rule's
 * executable definition WAS at snapshot time and nothing else; the evidence tuple on it names the
 * operator who ran the snapshot and says so in the rationale. It writes ZERO activation events —
 * so no bootstrap row is ever `active` in the derived window view, which is the whole point.
 *
 * IT IS NOT EXECUTED BY ANYTHING IN THIS BUILD. No route calls it, no cron calls it, no test calls
 * it against a database. Execution requires separate operator authorization (§3.8) and a caller
 * that does not exist yet.
 *
 * The ONE statement in this module that names lvc_recommendations, and it only SELECTs from it:
 * no INSERT, no UPDATE, no DELETE, no ALTER, no status value, no new row (kickoff §6 trap 1).
 * The NOT EXISTS guard makes a second run a no-op rather than a duplicate-key failure.
