// lib/ipd-audit/episode-adapter.ts — the bridge from the IPD audit pass to EpisodeState (#4 SL2).
//
// EpisodeState stays STANDALONE: it never imports ipd-audit. This adapter is the CONSUMER side —
// it knows both the ipd-audit read shapes (IpdAdmissionHeader, BillingEnvelope) and the
// EpisodeState input contract (KxEnvelope), and it wires build+persist into the audit pass as
// ADDITIVE + BEST-EFFORT: nothing here can throw, so a failure never breaks the audit that already
// ran. Forward-only (build at audit time); no backfill.

/**
 * PURE PHI-drop mapper: IpdAdmissionHeader + BillingEnvelope → the de-identified KxEnvelope.
 *
 * THE SECURITY BOUNDARY. IpdAdmissionHeader carries PHI — `patientName`, `uhid`, and the coarse
 * `ageGender` / `team` labels. This mapper is a WHITELIST: it constructs the envelope from an
 * explicit set of non-PHI fields, so a PHI field can never leak into EpisodeState even if the
 * header type later grows one. The structural test asserts the output keys are EXACTLY KxEnvelope's
 * and that no PHI value survives. Returns null when there is no link-back key to key on.
