/**
 * lib/ipd-episode/store.ts — Neon reads and writes for the IPD Episode Audit engine
 * (`ipd_episode_audits`, `ipd_episode_checkpoints`, `ipd_episode_skips`; migrations/0052).
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY SQL STRING HERE IS INFERRED against the DDL this build ships in the same commit. It has
 * not been run against Neon — the sandbox has no database. Every path is therefore FAIL-SAFE: a
 * reader returns [] or null on any fault (including "the migration has not run yet"), and a writer
 * returns a status rather than throwing. Nothing here can turn a completed audit into a 500.
 *
 * PHI POSTURE. The only identifying columns written are `encounter_id`, `ip_uid` and `member_id` —
 * link-back keys, the same posture as `ipd_discharge_audits`. No uhid, name, age, gender or
 * contact value is written by any statement in this file. `real_course`, `findings` and
 * `commentary` hold text that has already been through the de-identifier at assembly time.
 *
 * `ip_uid` AND `encounter_id` HOLD THE SAME VALUE, and that is deliberate rather than redundant:
 * `encounter_id` is this engine's own key, and `ip_uid` is the column name the sibling discharge
 * engine and `discharge_extracted_cases` use for the same namespace — so the join in
 * `dischargeEngineScores` below is a column-name match, not a transformation. Neither is ever
 * rewritten.

 * compared — and comparing them is the only way to see a reproducibility problem at all. Each run
 * is now an INSERT with its own `run_seq`; `is_current` marks exactly one row per
 * (encounter_id, engine_version), and worker selection and the UI list read only that.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CHECKPOINT FOREIGN KEY NEEDED NO CHANGE, which is worth stating rather than assuming.
 * `ipd_episode_checkpoints.episode_audit_id` references `ipd_episode_audits(id)` — the surrogate
 * uuid, not the (encounter_id, engine_version) pair — so a new run gets a new audit id and its
 * checkpoints attach to it. Previous runs keep their own checkpoint rows intact, and ON DELETE
 * CASCADE still means deleting a run takes its checkpoints with it. The old DELETE-then-insert of
 * checkpoints is gone with the upsert: there is nothing to clear, because the rows it would have
 * cleared belong to a different run.
 *
 * The two writes are sequenced — demote the current row, then insert the new one as current. These
 * are separate statements on the Neon HTTP driver, so a fault between them leaves NO current row
 * rather than two; the UI renders that as an absent episode and the next run repairs it. Two rows
 * claiming to be current would be worse, and the partial unique index makes it impossible anyway.
