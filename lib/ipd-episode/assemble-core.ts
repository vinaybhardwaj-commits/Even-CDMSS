/**
 * lib/ipd-episode/assemble-core.ts — the PURE half of episode assembly (PRD §3.2):
 * the event schema, the day index, ordering, the order-event roll-ups, the note summary,
 * author normalisation, and the blinding filters that build every checkpoint and pass input.
 *
 * NO db, NO model, NO Next. Everything here is a function of rows already fetched.
 *
 * TWO RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE STRUCTURAL, both of which a source-read test enforces:
 *
 * 1. IDS ARE NEVER REWRITTEN. `IPNO-1` and `IP-1` are different patients — measured on 585 of
 *    585 rewritten joins, none of which shared a uhid (DB addendum A2). So no trimming, no
 *    prefix substitution, no normalising: an id that arrives is the id that joins and the id
 *    that is stored.
 * 2. CLINICAL TIME IS NEVER THE MIRROR'S TIME. `_create_time` is when the Firestore mirror wrote
 *    the row (every progress note shows the same ingest day), and `created_at` agrees with the
 *    clinician-stated time on 20% of rows and is null on 148. The clinical timestamp is
 *    `progressnote_date_time` out of the component_json {name, valueString} array, then
 *    `g_creation_time`. An event whose clinical time cannot be resolved is Tier C and is
 *    excluded from every checkpoint input rather than guessed onto a day.
 *
 * AND ONE ARCHITECTURAL RULE, which is the blinding proof: every checkpoint input and every
 * pass input is produced by FILTERING the single assembled event list (`eventsBeforeDayStart`,
 * `episodeLevelEvents`, `diffPassEvents`, `fidelityPassEvents`). There is no second assembly
 * path, so no input can drift into carrying something the blinding rule excludes.

 * `kx_discharge_summary_records`, all 2,496 rows, 14 distinct values:
 *
 *     Normal Discharge 2236 · None 155 · LAMA 33 · DAMA 28 · Discharge On Request 18 ·
 *     Expired 8 · Admitted Dead 3 · Refer External Hospital 3 · (empty) 3 · Mortuary 3 ·

 * CASE-INSENSITIVE because the mirror carries both `Mortuary` (3) and `mortuary` (2); a
 * case-sensitive list would have exempted three episodes and audited two of the same kind normally.
 *
 * ⚠️ `Early Neonatal` IS DELIBERATELY NOT MATCHED. It may well be a neonatal death category, but it
 * may equally be a discharge category, and one row cannot settle it. An unrecognised value AUDITS
 * NORMALLY — which is the direction this must fail in. Exempting an episode from the terminal-day
 * rule on a guess would silently stop auditing a real admission; auditing a death as if it were a
 * discharge produces findings a human will notice and can correct. The loud failure is the safer
 * one, and it is the one a wrong guess here produces.
 *
 * EXACT match on the trimmed, lower-cased value, never a substring: `Refer External Hospital`
 * contains no death word today, but a substring rule is a standing invitation for one to appear.

 * ⚠️ WHAT THE CALENDAR PLAN COST, AT BOTH ENDS.
 *
 *   · `cp-d0`'s cutoff was `dayStartIso(admission, 0)` — the ADMISSION INSTANT. Nothing precedes an
 *     admission, so day 0 saw the admission event and nothing else: retrieval was skipped on 10 of
 *     12 episodes and every expectation it produced was uncited. A checkpoint that cannot see the
 *     first day of an admission cannot say anything about it.
 *   · Days beyond 6 were never checkpointed at all. On IPNO-495 days 7–11 held 115 of 414 events —
 *     28% of the admission — and produced ZERO expectations; days 7, 8 and 9 generated no findings
 *     of any kind. The longest stays were the least audited.
 *
 * The anchors are the moments an admission actually turns on:
 *
 *   first_24h          admission + 24h — the first day as a WINDOW, not an instant
 *   procedure          the day of each procedure (OT note, or a procedure/surgery billing line)
 *   procedure_plus_2   two days after each procedure
 *   procedure_plus_4   four days after each procedure
 *   pre_discharge      24h before discharge — the decision to send the patient home
 *   episode            unchanged: the whole admission, discharge event excluded
 *
 * Anchors falling on the same DAY collapse to one (the earliest cutoff wins, so the checkpoint sees
 * least), and the total is capped at MAX_CHECKPOINTS with the episode-level one always kept.
 *
 * ⚠️ BLINDING IS UNCHANGED IN PRINCIPLE AND RE-DERIVED PER ANCHOR: each checkpoint sees only events
 * strictly BEFORE its own cutoff, always the admission event, never the discharge event. The
 * cutoff is now a timestamp rather than a day boundary, which makes the rule easier to hold, not

/**
 * ROUND 20 ITEM 3c — HOW THE TENSION IS RESOLVED: A BOUNDED FALLBACK, NOT A BROADER WHITELIST.
 *
 * The whitelist exists because three strip-based attempts failed to keep inventory noise out of
 * retrieval (round 7 item 7). Widening it to "anything that looks like prose" would walk straight
 * back into that. But a deny-by-default list has a second failure mode the first three attempts did
 * not have: when a template's fields are ALL unknown, the query is not noisy — it is EMPTY, and an
 * empty query is not a safe default. It produced 40 expectations with no evidence behind them.
 *
 * So the whitelist stays authoritative, and a fallback runs only when it yields NOTHING for a
 * component block. The fallback is deliberately more suspicious than the whitelist:
 *   · person-named fields are dropped by the same `isPersonFieldName` rule that guards summaries;
 *   · markup, JSON and data URIs are stripped;
 *   · anything still containing a `data:` URI or base64 run is dropped whole;
 *   · the result is capped hard, because a fallback should contribute a hint, not a document.
 *
 * A known template is therefore as tightly controlled as before. An unknown one contributes
 * something cleaned rather than nothing at all, and the next unknown template after this one does
 * not need a code change to be audited with evidence.
