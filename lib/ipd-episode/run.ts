/**
 * lib/ipd-episode/run.ts — the seven-stage pipeline for ONE episode (PRD §2).
 * select → assemble → checkpoints → diff (A1) → fidelity (A2) → comment (B) → persist.
 *
 * TWO PROPERTIES THIS FILE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.
 *
 * 1. THE BLINDING. There is ONE assembled event list, and every model input below is a FILTER
 *    over it — `eventsBeforeDayStart` for each daily checkpoint, `episodeLevelEvents` for the
 *    episode one, `diffPassEvents` for A1, `fidelityPassEvents` for A2. Nothing here constructs a
 *    second list, and nothing here hands a pass a field its filter removed. The stored
 *    `input_cutoff_at` / `input_event_count` on each checkpoint row is the auditable proof, and
 *    §14 step 8 recomputes both from the stored course.
 *
 * 2. EVERY FAILURE DEGRADES TO A RECORDED NO-OP (§8). A db13 fault aborts this episode with no
 *    audit row and no skip row (it is a transport failure, not a fact about the episode). A
 *    missing summary, missing notes or missing extraction writes a SKIP with its reason. A failed
 *    A1 or A2 writes a skip. A failed B writes the audit row with `commentary = null`. No path
 *    returns a 500 and no path writes a value it did not derive.
