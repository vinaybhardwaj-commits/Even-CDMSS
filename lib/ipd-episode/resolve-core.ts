/**
 * lib/ipd-episode/resolve-core.ts — the DETERMINISTIC omission resolver (PRD decision 33,
 * V, 2026-09-02). Pure: no db, no model, no Next.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Three runs of IP-1286 scored 96, 100 and 80 on byte-identical
 * checkpoints, and across all three ZERO findings had an empty `evidence_basis` and ZERO rested on
 * a Tier C source — yet the judge returned 0, 12 and 11 `unassessable` verdicts, ten of them on
 * Tier A evidence. The model was not reporting that the mirror could not answer; it was declining
 * to commit. And the question it was declining on — did the expected thing happen — is not a
 * judgement at all. It is a lookup.
 *
 * DECISION 33: whether an expected action happened is a DATABASE QUESTION. Code decides it. The
 * model proposes what to expect, and its severity, while it is still blinded; this module answers
 * whether it happened. Nothing here can waver between runs, because nothing here asks an opinion.
 *
 * The four outcomes, and the one that is deliberately narrow:
 *
 *   PRESENT                 a matching event exists at or after the entry's by_day → concordant
 *   ABSENT, class present   the data class IS represented in this episode, so the absence is real
 *                           → divergent, at the severity proposed at generation time
 *   ABSENT, class missing   the class is not represented at all (no lab rows anywhere; vitals and
 *                           radiology are not in this mirror) → unassessable. THE ONLY PATH THAT
 *                           MAY PRODUCE unassessable.
 *   AMBIGUOUS               the class exists but cannot settle THIS question — a package bill can
 *                           hide a dispensed drug, a panel can hide an analyte → context_dependent
 *
 * Every finding records which path produced it, in `resolution`, together with the matcher that
 * resolved it. A validator can re-derive the whole omission set from the stored course and the
 * stored events without running a model.

/**
 * Is this data class represented in the episode at all?
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO CLASSES ARE NEVER REPRESENTED, AND THAT IS A FACT ABOUT THE MIRROR, NOT THIS EPISODE.
 * `vitals` has no table in the KX mirror at all (the Even-native `chart_*` layer holds observations
 * but its encounter namespace does not join — reference §2, overlap measured at zero). `imaging` is
 * effectively absent: `kx_radiology_reports` reaches 24 encounters by uhid and 1 by visit_id, and
 * `chart_radiology_report` has zero rows — the reference's own instruction is "treat radiology as
 * unavailable". An expectation of either therefore resolves `unassessable` on EVERY episode, which
 * is the honest answer: this pipeline cannot tell you whether a chest film was done.
 *
 * ⚠️ ROUND 14 ITEM 2 — THE WINDOW, NOT THE ADMISSION. `fromDay` scopes the question to the days the
 * expectation could have been satisfied in, and that changes the answer.
 *
 * On IPNO-416 four day-3 findings fired as real divergences on a day with ZERO progress notes,
 * because notes existed on days 0 to 2 and the class was therefore "represented". Admission-scoped
 * presence answers a question nobody asked: it says the hospital writes notes, not that it wrote
 * one on the day the expectation was about. Where the class is empty in the expectation's OWN
 * window, "it did not happen" and "nothing was recorded that day" are indistinguishable, and
 * `unassessable` is the only honest verdict.
 *
 * The day the class went silent is not lost with it — `discharge-day` documentation gaps become a
 * finding of their own in judge-core (`missingDischargeDayNote`), which is the signal that
 * day-scoping would otherwise swallow.

 *
 * A "repeat" expectation answered by the order that PROMPTED it is a silent false negative — the
 * audit reporting that a thing was done, using as proof the very thing whose repetition was being
 * asked for. It hides precisely the failure this engine exists to find.
 *
 * `fromDay` is the day the expectation was FORMED — the checkpoint's own day, not `by_day`. A
