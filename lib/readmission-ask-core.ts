/**
 * lib/readmission-ask-core.ts — PURE decisions for R4.3 "ask the agent" (CDMSS-READMISSIONS-R4.3-PRD
 * v1.0, R43-1..R43-8): the case MATERIAL the model may see (stored artefacts only), the caps
 * (question length, history turns, history size), and the answer verdict (citations enforced by
 * the same validator that guards narratives). No DB, no model, no clock.
 *
 * THE FENCE (the memo's rule): the conversation's whole world is this case's STORED material — the
 * evidence ledger, the agent's account, the judgements, the coverage, the two bills. Nothing new
 * enters the case through the ask-box.
 *
 * R9 (CDMSS-READMISSIONS-R9-DUAL-CONTRACT PRD, GO 27 Aug 2026, D12/D13/D14 + O1/O2 + T6) moves ONE
 * half of that last clause. The fence against inventing KX facts STANDS, unchanged: an agent claim
 * about the record still dies without a resolvable ledger citation. The fence against storing the
 * REVIEWER goes: a care manager's own stated clinical judgement is now persisted, beside the agent's
 * `avoidable` and never on top of it.
 *   · Turns persist per (dedup_key, engine_version, turn_index) and the SERVER is the thread's truth
 *     (O1) — the model window is the last ASK_HISTORY_MAX_TURNS turns, then the same token trim.
 *   · `gateOverlay` (§12.4) is the ONLY door to a `clinical_review` write, and it is a pure function
 *     so it can be argued with in a test rather than in production: assertion turn, `stated === true`,
 *     a closed-set decision, a quote that is REALLY a substring of what he typed, every other enum in
 *     its closed set. Anything else persists the turn, skips the overlay, and never 500s (T6).
 *   · What the overlay may never do (D14): touch `avoidable` / `planned` / `same_condition` /
 *     `preventable_injury` / `negligence`, or reach the incidence aggregator. Incidence is identical
 *     with the overlay present or absent (acceptance #6).

// it. The agent may now reach the PATIENT — prior IP stays, prior OPD notes, labs, the MemberState
// snapshot, care-manager interactions — and every one of those artefacts arrives de-identified,
// labelled, persisted, and CITABLE. What it still may not do is assert anything it cannot cite.

//      No free text reaches the prompt until the model asks for a specific artefact, which is what
//      makes "the whole record" affordable and what keeps the default prompt small.
//   2. THE IDS ARE STABLE (R10-D7). An id, once bound to an artefact, stays bound: `mintRecordIndex`
//      takes the bindings already persisted for the thread and reuses them, minting fresh ids only
//      for artefacts nobody has fetched. Without this a citation would silently re-point on reload —
//      the one failure mode a persisted-evidence design exists to make impossible.
//   3. THE CAP IS HONEST (R10-D5). Truncation is REPORTED, per kind, in the index the model reads.
//      "The 20 most recent" is a fact about the index; letting the model believe it saw everything
//      would be a lie told by omission, which is the family of defect this whole ship is about.
