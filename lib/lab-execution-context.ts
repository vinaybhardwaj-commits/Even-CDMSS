/**
 * lib/lab-execution-context.ts — the Lab v2 research/production isolation boundary
 * (LAB-MCP-V2-PRD-v1.0 §7, decision 6).
 *
 * A Lab v2 run executes a PRODUCTION clinical engine (auditOpdNote and friends) with
 * research inputs. The engine's own code reaches for production IO all over the place:
 * `sql` for the LVC rules and the doctor directory, `metabaseQuery` for db13, `retrieve`
 * for the corpus, the trace writers for observability. None of that may happen on a
 * research run — a research key must not be able to write a production row or spend a
 * production trace id, and it must not be able to do so by ACCIDENT either.
 *
 * The guard is an AsyncLocalStorage store rather than a parameter because the engine is
 * hundreds of call frames deep and threading a flag through all of them would be both a
 * huge diff and a thing a future edit could forget. A context is inherited by every
 * frame beneath it by construction, which is the property we actually want.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED. `sql` and `metabaseQuery` THROW inside the context (they are writes or
 * identifying reads); `retrieve` DELEGATES to the edge the caller supplied; the trace
 * writers return without writing. Outside the context every one of those functions is
 * byte-for-byte its current self — the guards are all `if (labExecution())` early exits,
 * so an unguarded (i.e. production) call pays one function call and one undefined check.
 *
 * ⚠️ `withLabExecution` may be imported ONLY from files under `lib/lab-v2/`. That is not
 * a convention, it is a gate: lib/lab-v2/__tests__/isolation.test.ts greps app/** and
 * lib/** and fails the build on any other importer. A stray `withLabExecution` in a
 * request path would silently swap real retrieval for a lab edge on a real patient's
 * note, which is the one failure this whole module exists to make impossible.
 *
 * LabError lives HERE rather than in lib/lab-v2/contracts.ts so that the four guarded
 * core files (db, metabase, retrieve, trace) import exactly one tiny module with no
 * dependencies of its own. contracts.ts re-exports it, so the PRD's "contracts.ts
 * exports LabError" still holds; what it must not do is pull zod into lib/db.ts's
 * module graph, which every route in the app already imports.
