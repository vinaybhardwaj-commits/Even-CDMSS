/**
 * lib/readmission/ask-store.ts — the R9 persistence layer for the case conversation
 * (CDMSS-READMISSIONS-R9-DUAL-CONTRACT PRD, D12 / D14 / O1 / O3; table `readmission_ask_turns` and
 * the `clinical_review_*` columns on `readmission_findings`, both created by
 * /api/admin/migrate-readmission-ask; reference DDL in migrations/0045).
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE THROUGHOUT — the whole file, both reads and writes, and that is a deliberate departure
 * from the R8.1 versions-store, whose insert THROWS. The reasoning is different here: a snapshot that
 * vanishes destroys evidence of an overwrite, whereas a chat turn that fails to persist must not cost
 * the care manager the ANSWER he is waiting for. So:
 *   · every function returns an honest empty / false, never a throw, never a 500;
 *   · the answer path is never blocked by a storage fault — the route reports `persisted:false` and
 *     the surface says the thread is not being kept, rather than pretending it is.
 * A consequence worth naming: before the migration has run, every call here soft-fails, the Ask box
 * behaves exactly as R4.3's ephemeral one did, and nothing else on the board notices.
 *
 * D14 — the write surface is FENCED IN CODE, not only by review: `saveClinicalReview` writes exactly
 * nine `clinical_review_*` columns in one statement and names them literally. `avoidable`, `planned`,
 * `same_condition`, `preventable_injury` and `negligence` do not appear in this file at all, and a
 * test asserts that by reading the source.
 *
 * ⚠️ INFERRED SQL throughout: this sandbox has no live Neon.
