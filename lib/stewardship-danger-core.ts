/**
 * lib/stewardship-danger-core.ts — who belongs in the danger queue, and what state they are in
 * (CDMSS-STEWARDSHIP-MS-AGENT-KICKOFF-v2-29-AUG-2026, A5; spec §4 D-escalate, acceptance #7 / #16).
 *
 * PURE AND DEPENDENCY-FREE except for `tierFor`, which is itself pure and is the ONLY thing allowed
 * to decide an OPD finding's severity. Nothing here re-derives a tier, invents an IPD regex table,
 * or writes anything. No ./db, no next/*.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE TWO LEGS OF "DANGEROUS", and why they are two.
 *
 *   1. SEVERITY — `tierFor` says tier 1 (E-1 / E-2, the ratified escalation entries). Tier 3 is
 *      log-only and never becomes a row; tier 2 is the week's work, not the queue's. PRAISE is
 *      outside the tier list entirely and is excluded unconditionally, including when it carries a
 *      contested pill: a finding that praises an appropriate ACS referral must not land in a queue
 *      whose whole meaning is "possible active patient risk".
 *
 *   2. DISPUTE — the latest human pill on the finding is `contested`. This is not a severity claim
 *      at all. It is an unresolved disagreement between the engine and a reviewer, and the reason
 *      it belongs in the same queue is that nobody has decided which of them is right yet.
 *
 * A finding qualifies on either leg. Whether it is COUNTED as open is a separate question, decided
 * by the pill, below.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A5 — THE IPD VOCABULARY IS SEVEN WORDS, NOT FOUR, AND THE ROUTE STAYS UNTOUCHED. The IPD feedback
 * route has accepted `agree`, `disagree` and `needs_action` since before the OPD-grade vocabulary
 * replaced them, and rows carrying all seven are in the table. The kickoff's decision is that the
 * READER maps them and the WRITER is not touched this ship — so the seven are mapped here, once,
 * and `app/api/admin/ipd-audit-feedback/route.ts` is not edited at all.
