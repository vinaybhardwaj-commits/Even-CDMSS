/**
 * lib/ipd-doctor-hop.ts — the PARTIAL inpatient → clinician identity hop
 * (CDMSS-STEWARDSHIP-MS-AGENT-KICKOFF-v2-29-AUG-2026, A1; spec §5.3, D-identity, acceptance #6).
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO BE.
 *
 * `ipd_discharge_audits` has no `doctor_uid` column and this file does not give it one. The hop is
 * READ-TIME ONLY (A1): db13's `kx_ip_admissions.current_treating_doctor_id` is a KarExpert
 * practitioner id, and `doctors` carries the same namespace in two places —
 * `karexpert_metadata__practitioner_id` and the VALUES of the jsonb
 * `karexpert_metadata__practitioner_id_by_hospital`. Their union is the only measured bridge.
 *
 * MEASURED 29 Aug 2026 on db13, checked into
 * `handoff-docs/CDMSS-STEWARDSHIP-SQL-VALIDATION-AND-HOP-MEASURE-29-AUG-2026.md`:
 *
 *   stays in the 90-day window          1267
 *   stays carrying a treating id        1045
 *   distinct treating ids                110
 *   match `doctors.uid`                    0 / 110
 *   match `karexpert_metadata__uid`        0 / 110
 *   match the practitioner-id union       68 / 110
 *   practitioner ids that are AMBIGUOUS     7   (each maps to exactly 2 doctors.uid)
 *   stays resolvable                     483 / 1045   (46.2%)
 *
 * So this hop resolves fewer than half the stays, and that is the honest ceiling — not a bug to be
 * engineered away with a looser rule.
 *
 * THE FOUR REFUSALS, each of which has a name because each has been proposed:
 *
 *   1. AN AMBIGUOUS PRACTITIONER ID NEVER RESOLVES. Seven ids map to two `doctors.uid` each. The
 *      in-window one is `0dd90283-71cf-11f0-9659-1243a45a76a3-1021357153`, 10 stays behind it, the
 *      SAME display name on both rows and two different e-mails. Picking either would be a coin
 *      toss recorded as a fact about a named clinician.
 *   2. E-MAIL IS NOT A TIEBREAK. The obvious repair — "when two uids compete, prefer the one whose
 *      e-mail matches" — dies on the measurement: Mahendra Jain's two rows share the identical
 *      address `mahijain@yahoo.com`. This file reads no e-mail column at all, and a test asserts it.
 *   3. NO DISPLAY-NAME JOIN, EVER (D-identity, refuse-list §8). Name matching was 87/140 at the
 *      27 Aug cut and it is forbidden regardless of its rate. `resolveDoctor` in
 *      lib/ipd-audit/doctor-lookup.ts stays exactly as it is — the IPD list's name chrome — and this
 *      file neither calls it nor duplicates it.
 *   4. NOTHING IS WRITTEN. No `doctor_uid` lands on `ipd_discharge_audits`. A1 says read time, and a
 *      stored hop would outlive the day its rate was measured.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Unmatched, ambiguous, unfilled, two treating ids on one stay,
 * db13 unreachable — every one of them is `unjoined`, and the surface shows the split banner and an
 * honest count rather than a number that quietly covers half the ward.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⚠️ INFERRED SQL: this sandbox has no live DB. The two db13 strings are exported verbatim in
 * `HOP_INFERRED_SQL` and listed in the slice report. `metabaseQuery` takes NO bind parameters
 * (lib/metabase.ts), so values are filtered and single-quote-escaped before interpolation — the same
 * `IN (…)` pattern lib/ipd-audit/doctor-lookup.ts already uses against this same database.
