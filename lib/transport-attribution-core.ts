/**
 * lib/transport-attribution-core.ts — dispatch evidence on a returned completion (PURE).
 * CDMSS-RERANK-TELEMETRY-CC-KICKOFF-11-AUG-2026 §4.4, Stage 0a step 2.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The mechanism below was written on 10 Aug for the LVC judge (GUARD-FIX PRD v3.0 D-8) and lived
 * in lib/trace.ts, because only the TRACED transport needed it. The rerank judge is TRACELESS
 * (lib/rerank.ts:311 passes `undefined` as the trace id, and kickoff constraint 2 forbids changing
 * that), so its transport is `chatWithFallback` in lib/llm.ts — which attaches nothing, and is why
 * §5 of the throttle-rate findings could not say which caller was throttled.
 *
 * lib/trace.ts already imports from lib/llm.ts, so lib/llm.ts cannot import back from lib/trace.ts.
 * The primitive therefore moves DOWN into a module both can depend on. lib/trace.ts re-exports
 * every name it previously declared, so no existing consumer moves — including
 * lib/__tests__/lvc-judge-attribution.test.ts, which imports all four from '../trace' and is one of
 * the four files held uncommitted on main that this build must not touch.
 *
 * ── THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THIS SAFE TO PUT ON THE PRODUCTION PATH ─────────────────────────────
 * The evidence is a NON-ENUMERABLE property on the object the provider SDK already returned. It is
 * invisible to `JSON.stringify`, to `Object.keys`, to spreads and to every existing consumer of a
 * completion; it allocates no new object; and `attach` never throws, even on a frozen or sealed
 * provider object. Attaching it cannot change a request, a provider choice, a retry, or a byte of
 * a response — which is exactly what §4.4 requires tests to prove before it may ship.

 * ⚠️ WHY A SECOND, SEPARATE MECHANISM AND NOT A NULLABLE `dispatched_provider`.
 *
 * `CdmssTransportAttribution` answers "which provider served this completion". When every route
 * fails there IS no completion, and PRD §4.4 is explicit that the record must then say so rather
 * than naming the last provider attempted. Widening the success type to carry a null provider
 * would put that "nobody served" state into a shape whose existing readers — `resolveJudgeAttribution`
 * in lib/lvc.ts — already branch on `dispatched_provider` being present. A separate type on a
 * separate property cannot reach those readers at all, which is what keeps §4.4 condition 4
 * (existing callers behaviourally compatible) true by construction rather than by test.
 *
 * This is the difference the PRD calls out twice and forbids merging: `unattributed` means a
 * completion may have arrived and we cannot say who served it. This type is the OTHER fact — the
 * proof that no completion arrived at all, which is what licenses `not_served`.
