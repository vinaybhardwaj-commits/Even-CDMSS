/**
 * lib/architecture/manifests.ts — the central module-manifest registry (System Map Stage 1).
 * Seeded from docs/architecture/INVENTORY.md (the source of truth for planes/edges): the 6
 * governed modules, plus this directory itself as infra. STRUCTURAL-FIRST: `owner`,
 * `clinicianApprover` and `validationEvidence` are deliberately unassigned — the map renders
 * them as honest "unassigned" gaps rather than guessed names. `forbiddenImports` is also left
 * empty: the enforced edges live in scripts/architecture-check.mjs's RULES (the map projects
 * them from there), and duplicating them here would be a drift risk, not a fact.
 *
 * COVERAGE (enforced by `npm run architecture:check`): every top-level lib/ subsystem — see
 * listSubsystems() in scripts/lib/import-scan.mjs for the exact definition — must appear here
 * (via a manifest's `paths`) or in UNREGISTERED below. A new module cannot silently escape
 * the map.
