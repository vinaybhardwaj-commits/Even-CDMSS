/**
 * lib/preop-assemble-core.ts — turning many observations into ONE set of instrument
 * inputs, and one set of inputs into ONE snapshot (PRD v1.1-LOCKED §5, §7, §8;
 * Build Plan B1).
 *
 * NO database, NO fetch, NO clock, NO model. The clock is the caller's: `computedAt`
 * and `daysToSurgery` arrive as arguments so this file stays testable and so two
 * snapshots computed from the same evidence are byte-identical whenever they run.
 *
 * THREE JOBS
 *
 * 1 · SOURCE PRECEDENCE (mockup note 3). Several sources may back one input; the
 *     highest-precedence one SCORES it and the rest corroborate:
 *         LAB / PAC-mapped  >  BOOKING  >  EXTRACTED
 *     LAB and PAC tie deliberately — a mapped PAC field and an Eka lab value are both
 *     the primary record of what they describe, and they describe different things.
 *     Ties break on the most recent observation, then on input order, so the result is
 *     a pure function of the observation list.
 *
 * 2 · CONFLICT TAGGING. When a losing observation asserts the OPPOSITE status the input
 *     is tagged `conflict` and both chips render (mockup note 3). The conflict never
 *     changes the score — precedence already decided that — it changes what the reader
 *     is shown, which is the honest handling of two records that disagree.
 *
 * 3 · THE CONFIDENCE FLOOR (PRD §7). An EXTRACTED observation below the floor is
 *     DROPPED, not down-weighted, and the input falls back to whatever else backs it —
 *     usually nothing, i.e. UNKNOWN, which widens the instrument to a range. This is the
 *     PRD's "low-confidence extraction feeds the same §8 degradation machinery as a
 *     missing input. No new uncertainty concept."
 *
 * CLOSED WORLD, STATED OUT LOUD. A booking form ENUMERATES a patient's comorbidities,
 * so a comorbidity absent from a form that exists is `absent`, not `unknown` — that is
 * the only reason Lakshmamma's booking-only Charlson is a point score of 3 rather than a
 * range from 3 to 27. Inputs that no enumeration can close (creatinine, functional
 * status, the procedure's risk class, age) are `unknown` until something observes them.
 * If there is no booking form at all, nothing is closed and everything is unknown.

/**
 * Bumped when precedence, the floor, the closed-world set or the snapshot shape change.
 *
 * ⚠️ B5 (27 Aug 2026) CHANGED THE RESOLUTION AND DELIBERATELY DID NOT BUMP THIS. The rule
 * now resolves deterministic observations first and alone, and lets an extraction decide
 * only where they are silent. With PREOP_EXTRACT_ENABLED off — how Slice 1 ships — there
 * are no extracted observations to resolve, so the reading is byte-identical to
 * preop-assemble/1 as shipped, proven by the whole-snapshot equality assertion in
 * preop-d4-boundary.test.ts and by the four mockup patients reproducing unchanged.
 *
 * This constant is INSIDE the snapshot fingerprint. Bumping it for a change that provably
 * moves no reading would mint a version row for every episode on the board and put a step
 * into a clinical timeline that says nothing happened — the same trap B4 hit when the PAC
 * workflow status briefly entered the fingerprint. The flip of the extraction flag is
 * itself the A/B boundary, and the snapshots that re-mint on that day will re-mint for a
 * reason a reader can see.

    // The B5 kickoff says "an extraction may only fill an input that is UNKNOWN after the

    // EXTRACTED). Amendment A1-6, ratified in the same kickoff, calls a closed-world
    // absence "a WEAK form-negative with its basis on display".
    //
    // Read strictly, the first sentence makes a form's SILENCE unbeatable — and the
    // binding mockup's own worked example breaks on it: Shobha K's ischaemic heart disease
    // ("MI 2019") and her hypertension ("Telmisartan 40") are both drawn as pink EXTRACTED
    // chips against a booking form that enumerated neither. Applied strictly, this module
    // would score her RCRI 1 where the approved mockup says 2.

    //   · a lab, a mapped PAC field, an ICD code, or a booking form's POSITIVE assertion
    //     is a deterministic source and outranks any extraction, always;
    //   · a weak form-negative — an absence inferred from an enumeration's silence — is
    //     the one thing an above-floor extraction with a verbatim citation may overturn,
    //     and when it does, the conflict flag is raised and BOTH are shown on the card.
