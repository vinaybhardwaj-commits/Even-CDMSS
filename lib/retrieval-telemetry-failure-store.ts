/**
 * lib/retrieval-telemetry-failure-store.ts — per-run telemetry-write failure evidence.
 * On-path kickoff D2, D12. PRD v2.1 §3 constraint 8 (fail visibly).
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE LAST LINE, AND IT IS FAIL-OPEN. Every write here is wrapped so its own exception
 * cannot propagate. When it throws, exactly two things happen and nothing else: a log line, and an
 * increment of `telemetry_write_failures` on the invocation row. If that increment throws too, a
 * log line and nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE COUNTER IS A COLUMN, NOT A VARIABLE. §4.1 forbids mutable process-global state, and a
 * per-process number would not survive the invocation anyway — the whole point of this counter is
 * that it is readable AFTER the invocation that failed is gone. The invocation row is the honest
 * record, or there is none.
