/**
 * lib/stay-library/build.ts — the IMPURE half of the stay library
 * (CDMSS-CASE-AGENTS-SPINE-PRD-v1.0-27-AUG-2026, P2 / §4, O9 / O10).
 *
 * One stay in, one library out: the discharge extract the IPD audit already stored, plus the OT,
 * PAC and progress rows already on db13, each turned into a ClinicalState by the pure builders in
 * ./core and written to `clinical_states`.
 *
 * IT INVENTS NO READS (§4, hard). Every db13 hop here is an EXISTING fetcher in
 * lib/readmission/db13.ts, called read-only and unmodified — `fetchOtNotes`, `fetchPacNotes`,
 * `fetchProgressNotes` — and the discharge document is the stored `ExtractedCase` from
 * `discharge_extracted_cases`. The only tables in play are the three `kx_clinical_template_*`
 * tables plus that extract store. If a fifth table ever looks necessary, the instruction is to STOP
 * and flag, not to add one here.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, EVERYWHERE (§4). Each document class is fetched independently and each failure is
 * local: a faulted OT hop costs the OT class and nothing else, and the stay still builds on what
 * exists. The three outcomes are kept apart all the way into storage — a fetch that FAULTED is
 * recorded `unavailable` and must never read as `absent`, because lying about which one happened is
 * how "no OT note" becomes "no operation".
 *
 * PHI. Template `note` / `component_json` are raw KX text and may carry a patient name. Every string
 * that becomes stored state goes through `deidText` bound to THIS stay's identity — the same choke
 * point lib/readmission/assemble.ts uses — and the pure builders take that scrubber as a required
 * argument, so a caller cannot forget it. The identity itself (name, UHID) is read here and stored
 * nowhere.

 *                  counts it `failed`, stores nothing, and the row is walked again next pass.
