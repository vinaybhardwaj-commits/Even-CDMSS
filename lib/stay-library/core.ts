/**
 * lib/stay-library/core.ts — the PURE half of the per-stay ClinicalState library
 * (CDMSS-CASE-AGENTS-SPINE-PRD-v1.0-27-AUG-2026, P2 / §4, O9 / O10).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The IPD audit reads one document: the discharge-summary PDF. Meanwhile the OT note,
 * the pre-anaesthetic check and the ward progress notes already sit on db13, already fetched by the
 * readmission agent as its source 4. P2 turns each of those documents into ONE ClinicalState with
 * source spans, so P3 can audit a STAY rather than a summary and P4 has something with provenance to
 * promote from.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST, and the reason half this file is about absence: **silence is unknown**
 * (D13). A stay with no OT row is a stay whose theatre record we have not seen — it is NOT a stay
 * with no operation. The distinction is carried all the way into storage: every document class that
 * yields nothing still writes a row, with `status: 'not_auditable'` and a REASON that separates
 * "we looked and the row is not there" (`absent`) from "the look itself faulted" (`unavailable`)
 * from "the row exists and its text is empty" (`empty`). `lib/readmission/db13.ts` already draws
 * that line for its coverage chips — a faulted hop is `unknown`, never `absent` — and this library
 * would be lying if it collapsed them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO:
 *   · never invent a procedure from a missing OT note (D13, §4);
 *   · never emit `administered` on a medication — there is no MAR in the substrate, so a discharge
 *     list is `prescribed` and nothing else, enforced by `assertNoAdministered` and a test (§8 #7);
 *   · never fork lib/clinical-state/schema.ts. The stay-specific facts ride in `surfaceExtras`,
 *     which is exactly the passthrough the core defines for fields it deliberately doesn't model.
 *     `CLINICAL_STATE_VERSION` stays 'clinical-state/1.2' (§7).
 *
 * PURE: no DB, no model, no clock, no I/O. The de-identifier is a REQUIRED ARGUMENT rather than an
 * optional step, so no caller can build a state out of raw template text by forgetting to scrub it.
