 * longer, exactly when the tick most needs to finish and report.
 *
 * MEASURED 27 Jul (probe `probe_r2_envelope_01`, 20 uids, evalConcurrency 6): the tick started
 * 14:22:00, wrote 5 rows by 14:26:54, then died. `app_settings.lab_batch_last` still held the 12:46
 * tick at 14:37 — the tick never completed — and `lab_batch_last_error` was EMPTY throughout,
 * because the invocation was killed mid-retry: the throw never completed, `drainOne` never caught
 * it, and the error key was never written.

 * EVAL_TICK_MAX. MEASURED on the live run `det_08114_25pro_seed_a` (gemini-2.5-pro, concurrency 10,
 * 178.4s mean audit): sliceSize 50 at concurrency 10 is ~890s of work inside ONE function
 * invocation. Vercel killed it at ~200–225s, so the `finally` that clears LB_KEYS.lock never ran,
 * the lock stayed set, and every subsequent cron tick skipped 'locked' for the full 900s TTL —
 * observed duty cycle 19% (bursts of ~200s separated by gaps of 848s and 704s). The corroborating
 * field: app_settings.lab_batch_last still held the 26 Jul MINI summary, i.e. no eval tick had ever
 * reached the line that writes it.
 *
 * With sliceSize == concurrency a tick dispatches exactly one wave and awaits it, so tick duration
 * is ONE audit's latency whatever the model does and the invocation cannot be killed by fan-out
 * depth. EVAL_TICK_MAX is retained as a hard CEILING (D2), not the default — it binds only if
 * concurrency is ever raised above it.
 *
 * NOT a wall-clock budget (considered, rejected): with one wave there is no dispatching after t=0,
 * so a budget would never fire — dead code asserting a protection it does not provide.
