/**
 * lib/lvc-judge-aa-core.ts — LVC applicability-judge A/A comparator (PURE).
 * DETERMINISM-TRIO PRD v1.0 §4 (D-4: MEASURE ONLY), 8 Aug 2026.
 *
 * WHAT AN A/A RUN IS. The same judge, the same model, the same configuration, asked the SAME
 * question twice. Any disagreement is the judge disagreeing with itself — there is no second
 * condition to attribute it to. `defaultJudge` (lib/lvc.ts:149) runs at temperature 0.1 with no
 * seed and no top_p, and it is the gate on every LVC finding: this file is the instrument that
 * measures how often that gate answers differently on identical input.
 *
 * PURE AND DEPENDENCY-FREE (type-only imports), so it loads under `node --experimental-strip-types`
 * and is unit-tested without a DB, an LLM or a network. It DECIDES NOTHING: no threshold lives here
 * — PRD §4.3 records the 95% decision rule as V's, to be made on the report this produces.
 *
 * PAIRING IS BY REC ID, NEVER BY POSITION. parseJudgeResponse builds its result from the model's
 * own array and back-fills the rest, so run B can return the same verdicts in a different order.
 * Comparing index-to-index would manufacture flips out of ordering noise. A rec present in one run
 * and absent from the other is counted as `unmatched` and never silently dropped.
