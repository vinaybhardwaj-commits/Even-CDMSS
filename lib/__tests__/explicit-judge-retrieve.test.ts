/**
 * lib/__tests__/explicit-judge-retrieve.test.ts — J3 and J4, through the real `retrieve` and
 * `retrieveMultiQuery`, against the real loopback judge.
 *
 * GOVERNED BY addendum v15 (signed by V, 16 August 2026), sections 3 and 4.1, under Saul review 27
 * and review 28. Kickoff v11 §9 is the numbering authority for J3 and J4.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PROVES.
 *   · J3. `retrieve` under a hostile Cohere default. The OMITTED-backend control demonstrates
 *         Cohere intent and downgrade. The EXPLICIT-judge arm shows zero Cohere outbound requests,
 *         judge intent, judge service, no downgrade, nonzero batches, and actual reordering.
 *         "Zero Cohere outbound requests" is a WIRE fact (v15 §4.1): no request leaves for any
 *         Cohere endpoint during the explicit-judge arm. It is observed on the transport, not
 *         inferred from a counter — the counter-level fact is J2's, in `rerank-pass-2.test.ts`.
 *   · J4. `retrieveMultiQuery` keeps reranking OFF on every retrieval arm and performs EXACTLY ONE
 *         fusion-level rerank whose third argument is the value the caller passed as
 *         `opts.rerankBackend` — here `'judge'` — as OBSERVED at that seam.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM.
 *   · Nothing about expansion "agreeing" on a rerank backend. Expansion is independent (v15 §3, J4).
 *   · Nothing about `rerankBackend` being ABSENT on the retrieval arms. The spread carries it onto
 *     every arm by design; what is asserted is the OBSERVED `useReranker` on each arm, which is what
 *     turns reranking off there.
 *   · Nothing about TCP framing, TLS or headers.
 *
 * HOW `retrieve` IS DRIVEN WITHOUT A DATABASE. The db stub (`installDbStub`) replaces
 * `globalThis.fetch` and routes Neon-shaped statements by regex to fixture rows, exactly as
 * `retrieval-ranking-invariance.test.ts` does. The OpenAI SDK does not use `globalThis.fetch` — it
 * binds node-fetch at client construction — so the judge requests reach the loopback server on a
 * real socket while the SQL never leaves the process. Both stubs coexist by construction.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE WIRE CLAIM OBSERVABLE. `cohereRelevanceScores` in `lib/rerank.ts`
 * calls the global `fetch`. With the db stub installed, a Cohere request would arrive at the stub's
 * fetch, which fails closed on a non-Neon body — so it cannot escape to the network — and it is
 * COUNTED by a spy wrapped around that fetch. Zero Cohere outbound requests means: the spy saw no
 * request to any Cohere endpoint, AND the loopback recorder saw only judge and embedding traffic.
 *
 * ORDER OF EVALUATION (v15 §10.4): server first, then the dynamic imports.
