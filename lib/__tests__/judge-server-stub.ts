/**
 * lib/__tests__/judge-server-stub.ts — a local HTTP server standing in for the rerank judge, so
 * `rerankJudge` runs for real against a real socket.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT A TEST FILE, AND DELIBERATELY NOT NAMED `.test.ts`. The suite glob is
 * `lib/**\/__tests__/*.test.ts`; `telemetry-db-stub.ts` is named the same way for the same reason.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS WORKS EVEN WITH `installDbStub` INSTALLED. The whole pass rests on it. ─────────────
 * `telemetry-db-stub.ts:103` replaces `globalThis.fetch`. The OpenAI SDK does not use it.
 * `node_modules/openai/core.js:144` is `this.fetch = overriddenFetch ?? index_1.fetch`, bound at
 * client CONSTRUCTION (`lib/llm.ts:41`), and the resolved shim is node-fetch@2, which uses the
 * `http` module. Verified in-process, before and after a stub-style replacement:
 *
 *     require('openai/_shims/index.js').fetch === globalThis.fetch   // false, both times
 *
 * So a judge request bypasses the database stub entirely and reaches a real socket on 127.0.0.1.
 * Nothing here ever opens a socket to any other host.
 *
 * ── HOW ONE BATCH IS TOLD FROM ANOTHER: ONLY BY PASSAGE TEXT. ──────────────────────────────────
 * Model, system prompt, temperature, max_tokens, options, keep_alive and the `QUESTION:` prefix are
 * byte-identical across batches, and `[${idx}]` at `lib/rerank.ts:431` is the LOCAL slice index, so
 * it restarts at `[0]` every batch and carries no batch identity.
 *
 * Every fixture passage therefore begins with a unique marker token, and this server scores each
 * passage by the marker it finds inside that passage's own `[idx]` segment. The reply's keys are the
 * local indices the caller used, so the same marker scores the same wherever it lands. Two
 * constraints on a fixture, from `lib/rerank.ts:430` and `:59`: the text is truncated to
 * `MAX_SNIPPET_CHARS = 600` FIRST and only then whitespace-collapsed, so a marker must sit inside
 * the first 600 characters and must survive `.replace(/\s+/g, ' ')`. A leading single-word token
 * satisfies both.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE SERVER RETURNS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * HTTP 200, `content-type: application/json`. Only three fields are read, at `lib/rerank.ts:461-464`:
 * `choices[0].message.content`, `usage.prompt_tokens`, `usage.completion_tokens`. `content` is the
 * scoring object as a STRING. `usage` is omitted by default: both `typeof` guards then go false, the
 * two token counts become null, and the batch still records `outcome: 'success'` — nothing throws.

/**
 * WHY `net.Socket.prototype.connect` (v15 §10.1). It is the one seam every path this pass touches
 * goes through: loopback `http`, remote `http`, `tls.connect`, and Node's native `fetch`. It was
 * tested against all four. `http.Agent.prototype.createConnection` is NOT that seam — the OpenAI
 * SDK's node shim installs `agentkeepalive`, which supplies its own `createConnection`, so an Agent
 * patch would miss the SDK's traffic entirely, which is the traffic that matters here.
 *
 * ⚠️ THREE FACTS THE IMPLEMENTATION HANDLES (v15 §10.2).
 *
 *   1. The argument shape is not uniform. Through `http`/`https` — the OpenAI path — the first
 *      argument is an ARRAY of `[options, callback]`, because `net.createConnection` normalizes its
 *      arguments before calling `socket.connect`. Through `tls.connect` it is a plain object.
 *      `hostOf` normalizes both, then reads `host ?? hostname`. A guard reading only
 *      `args[0].host` refuses loopback, because `args[0]` is the array.
 *   2. A throw inside the guard is SYNCHRONOUS. It escapes the caller rather than arriving as an
 *      `error` event. The guard's own test uses `try`/`catch`, not a listener.
 *   3. The guard sees HOSTNAMES, not resolved addresses. DNS has not run at this point.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `localhost` DECISION (v15 §10.3 item 1), stated explicitly: `localhost` is REFUSED.
 * The guard permits the literal `127.0.0.1` and nothing else. Reasons, in order of weight:
 *   - `localhost` is a NAME, and the guard sees names before DNS runs. On a host whose resolver
 *     maps `localhost` to `::1` first, or to anything a hosts file says, the name is not the
 *     loopback address the guard is meant to permit. Permitting the name would permit whatever the
 *     resolver decides, which is precisely the indirection this guard exists to remove.
 *   - Every path this pass drives already dials the literal address: `startJudgeServer` sets
 *     `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, and the connection-guard test dials it the
 *     same way. Nothing in the pass needs the name.
 *   - Refusing is the failure-closed direction. A test that dials `localhost` fails loudly and is
 *     corrected to the literal; a guard that admitted the name could admit a non-loopback target
 *     silently.
 * If a later pass needs `localhost`, it widens the allow-list deliberately, in writing, and states
 * why the resolver indirection is acceptable there.
 *
 * TLS is refused unconditionally (item 2). The pass opens no TLS connection to anything, so a TLS
 * attempt is by construction an escape to a real remote host — the Cohere endpoint being the one
 * this suite is most exposed to.
 *
 * Every other host is refused with an error NAMING THE HOST (item 3), so the failure a reader sees
 * says where the socket was going.
 *
 * `uninstallConnectionGuard` restores the original prototype method (item 4) so the guard does not
 * leak into later test files in the same process. Idempotent in both directions.

 * Normalize the argument shapes and return the host being dialled, or null if none is visible.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THE PROBE SHOWED, AND WHY THIS READS ONLY `host ?? hostname`. Run against Node with a
 * throwing prototype patch, `http.get` arrives as an ARRAY `[options, cb]` whose options object
 * carries `servername: ""` (an EMPTY STRING, not undefined) and `path: "/x"` (the URL PATH, not a
 * unix socket). A first draft of this function read `'servername' in o` as a TLS signal and
 * `typeof o.path === 'string'` as a unix-socket signal, and both misfired on plain http — every
 * loopback connection was refused as TLS. Neither option is a reliable discriminator, so neither is
 * read here. TLS is decided by the CALLER from the socket itself (`this.encrypted`, set on a
 * `TLSSocket`), which is the only signal that cannot be spoofed by an options object.
