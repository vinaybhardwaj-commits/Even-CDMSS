// Metamorphic relations over the OPD deterministic leg — CI hard gate (PRD
// CDMSS-METAMORPHIC-AND-SYNTHETIC-CONTROLS v1.0 §3, M1). ONE definition of every relation:
// this file only asserts what lib/metamorphic-core.ts `runRelations()` returns — the same call
// the engine-health panel renders live.
//
// KNOWN-DEFECT PINNING: three relations FAIL at 46c7cf9 / opd-note-audit/0.81.17 — D-5 (no
// release-profile awareness, observed class Q2), D-7 (antiplatelet-dose aspirin treated as an
// analgesic NSAID, observed class Q28, named unanimously) and G-1 (finding_ref changes under
// medications[] reorder — surfaced BY this suite). The PRD forbids fixing the engine in this
// build (§3.1, §6) and a permanently-red gate stops all work (M1's own rationale), so each
// relation is asserted to MATCH its measured, ratified status instead of asserted green. If the
// engine changes so a pinned failure starts passing (or a pass starts failing), this test fails
// LOUDLY and RATIFIED_RELATION_STATUS must be re-ratified with V.
