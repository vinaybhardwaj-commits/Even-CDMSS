/**
 * lib/__tests__/telemetry-overhead-guard.test.ts — the five guards on the temporary measurement
 * route, each proven by execution (addendum v4 §3, §6, §10).
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY CASE RUNS IN A CHILD PROCESS. Three of the five guards read `process.env` at request
 * time and one reads the clock, and a serverless request IS one process — so a case that mutated
 * `process.env` in the shared test process would prove less and could leak into its neighbours.
 * Each child gets its own environment, and guard 5's child gets its own `Date.now`.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO SOCKET IS OPENED, TO ANY HOST. The child installs `telemetry-db-stub`, which replaces
 * `globalThis.fetch` — the transport the Neon driver uses — before the route runs. So even the
 * all-guards-pass case, which proceeds into the DDL and a measurement cell, never leaves the
 * process. `DATABASE_URL` in these cases is a syntactically valid but entirely fictional endpoint.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ROUTE THIS TESTS IS TEMPORARY AND IS OWED A DELETION (addendum v4 §12). When
 * `app/api/admin/telemetry-overhead/route.ts` goes, this file goes with it.
