/**
 * lib/__tests__/llm-call-bounds.test.ts — D-1 (Right Care reliability §3, 31 Jul 2026):
 * bound every provider call.
 *
 *   node --test --import tsx lib/__tests__/llm-call-bounds.test.ts
 *
 * Kickoff §Tests 1–5. The constants are module-level env reads, so the matrix runs against the
 * exported pure resolvers (the resolveEnvRerankBackend pattern, ratified in Addendum B) and the
 * client constructions are pinned at the source. Test 5 is FUNCTIONAL: a local HTTP server that
 * accepts and never responds proves the ceiling fires, surfaces as a normal Error, and that
 * maxRetries 0 means exactly one wire call.

// ── §T4 — THE REGRESSION GUARD: the audit's effective ceiling clears real latency, not 90 s ──
//
// ⚠️ THE SOURCE OF THAT CEILING CHANGED ON 3 AUGUST (DEC-B9), and its premise was disproven.
// This test used to require `timeoutMs: LLM_AUDIT_TIMEOUT_MS` at the call site and to justify it
// with "p75 is 425 s". BOTH have moved:
//   · The 425 s figure was carried between documents and never re-measured. MEASURED on
//     v_trace_summary, opd_note_audit successes 30 Jul–2 Aug: p50 52–93 s, p75 90–209 s,
//     p95 309–393 s. The ceiling must clear the real distribution, not the retracted one.
//   · Once tracedChat began forwarding the caller's ceiling into openrouterCreateWithRetry,
//     LLM_AUDIT_TIMEOUT_MS (600,000) and PROVIDER_BUDGETS.audit.perAttemptMs became the same slot.
//     600,000 × 2 legs is 1,200,000 in an 800,000 box, so V ruled the call site sends the BUDGET.
//
// THE PROPERTY THIS TEST DEFENDS IS UNCHANGED: the audit's effective ceiling must be an explicit
// audit-class value that comfortably clears measured latency, and must never fall back to the 90 s
// general client bound, which would break the engine.
