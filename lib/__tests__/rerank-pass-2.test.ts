/**
 * lib/__tests__/rerank-pass-2.test.ts — proofs 2, 16, 17, 18 and 70, and J2.
 *
 * GOVERNED BY addendum v15 (signed by V, 16 August 2026), sections 3, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5, under
 * Saul review 27 and review 28. Kickoff v11 §6 is the numbering authority for the five proofs, and
 * §9 for J2. Proof text is quoted from kickoff v11 by proof NUMBER, never by line. Addendum v18
 * (signed by V, 16 August 2026, under Saul review 29) governs the pass 2 proof repairs in this
 * file: real `validateManifest` output feeding `verdictForRun` on both a clean and a dirty arm for
 * proofs 16 and 70 (§3.1), proof 18's Cohere arm delegating to the real `rerankCohere` (§3.3),
 * proof 2.2's replaced discriminator (§3.4), proof 70's order observed at invocation (§3.5), and
 * J2's pinned failure outcomes with judge-call counts (§3.6).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PROVES.
 *   · Proof 2.  The `cohereFn` adapter passes the capture as capture and not as `fetch`, and the
 *              Cohere path still works with an injected `fetchImpl`.
 *   · Proof 16. Cohere soft failure: more than one candidate, Cohere selected, an untyped throw,
 *              `inputOrder()` returned, one synthesised `terminal_failure` batch per planned
 *              boundary, expected equals recorded, `rerank_soft_failed` true, and the row not partial.
 *   · Proof 17. The judge path cannot reach `inputOrder()`: a per-batch throw warns, continues, and
 *              leaves `rerank_soft_failed` false.
 *   · Proof 18. `expected_batch_count` equals `ceil(retained_pool / JUDGE_BATCH)` when the judge
 *              served and 1 when Cohere served; always derived from `served_backend`, never from
 *              `intended_backend`. `JUDGE_BATCH` is READ FROM THE SOURCE TEXT of `lib/rerank.ts`,
 *              not imported and not hard-coded (v15 §4.3, kickoff §3.1).
 *   · Proof 70. The Cohere-to-judge downgrade, four assertions in order (v15 §4.3): the runtime
 *              order, the manifest facts, `persisted_complete` by the composition in v15 §4.4, and
 *              source parity of provider selection and fallback order against 72960baa.
 *   · J2.       Explicit judge invokes neither `checkHealthy` nor `cohereFn`, under a judge default
 *              and under a hostile Cohere default, on success and on failure. Call-local, with
 *              injected counters through `RerankDeps`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM.
 *   · Nothing about the wire. J2 is a CALL-LEVEL fact proved with counters; the wire-level fact —
 *     zero Cohere outbound requests through `retrieve` — is J3's, in
 *     `explicit-judge-retrieve.test.ts` (v15 §4.1). The two are not merged.
 *   · Nothing about "the base-to-commit production byte comparison" review 28 named. That phrase
 *     is defined nowhere in the corpus; addendum v15 §4.3 declines it pending clarification. Proof
 *     70's byte requirement is the SOURCE-PARITY sentence quoted from kickoff v11, and that is what
 *     70.4 asserts.
 *   · No database. `persisted_complete` is asserted by composing the real, pure production
 *     functions (v15 §4.4), not by writing or reading a row.
 *
 * COLLABORATORS. The real `rerank`, `rerankCohere`, `rerankJudge` and `_resetRerankHealth` from
 * `lib/rerank.ts`. The real loopback judge for the judge arms. Injected `RerankDeps` for the
 * counters and the Cohere failure modes. An injected `fetchImpl` for proof 2, so no socket opens
 * to any Cohere endpoint. The connection guard is installed for the whole file.
 *
 * ORDER OF EVALUATION (v15 §10.4): server first, then the dynamic imports.
