/**
 * lib/__tests__/ipd-episode-resolve.test.ts — the deterministic omission resolver (PRD decision 33).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE MATTERS MORE THAN ITS SIZE SUGGESTS. Three runs of IP-1286 scored 96, 100 and 80
 * on byte-identical checkpoints, and every point of that spread came from the judge's verdicts on
 * omissions. Decision 33 moves those verdicts into code. If this module is deterministic and
 * correct, the omission half of the score stops moving; these tests are what "deterministic and
 * correct" means in practice.
