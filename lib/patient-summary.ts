/**
 * lib/patient-summary.ts — Patient Summary API (Pulse), WIRED half. 30 Jul 2026.
 *
 * Orchestrates the PRESERVED CCB mechanics into the namespaced package Pulse renders before an
 * encounter: episode assembly → grounded brief → ClinicalState → MemberStateSnapshot → provenance.
 * The pure contract (shape, degraded rules, disclaimer, job ids) lives in patient-summary-core.
 *
 * ⚠️ Everything this module calls is the RETIRED-but-LIVE CCB code. See the header on
 * lib/ccb-brief.ts before deleting anything that looks unused.
 *
 * PHI: identifiers ride the package's episode.keys for join-back only, exactly as CCB's
 * member_ref did — they never enter a model payload. Nothing new is persisted.

 * unbounded deliberation, and that deliberation is what kills the call: Pro emits NO BYTES while
 * it thinks and OpenRouter closes the connection after ~125–155s of silence ("Upstream idle
 * timeout exceeded", 504 inside an HTTP 200).
 *
 * Expressed in the Vertex form, which is the only form Vertex honors; buildOpenrouterParams
 * translates it to OpenRouter's `reasoning.max_tokens` for the bridge (part 1). So ONE field caps
 * the leg on both transports.
 *
 * MEASURED, 20 calls per arm at concurrency 4 (failures/20, p90): uncapped 11, 72.7s · 4096 1,
 * 64.0s · 1024 0, 33.2s · 512 0, 26.0s. The reliability rule alone picks 1024 — V ruled 4096 on
 * the FINDINGS (31 Jul 2026), and the reason is worth keeping here so nobody "optimises" it back:
 * at 1024 the leg kept 2 of 13 reportFindings items, so an entire abdominal ultrasound vanished
 * from the summary; and its negative spans came back as bare nouns ("vegetation") whose source
 * sentence was "No clots, vegetation, or pericardial effusion" — verbatim-verifiable, correctly
 * statused, but the span no longer carries the negation a reader would check. Under-extraction
 * and a degraded evidence trail beat 1 failure in 20, which the package reports as degraded.
 * 1-in-20 is a WEAK estimate (true rate plausibly 1–20%); register T-12 holds the 100-call
 * re-measure and the bounded retry, both parked by V for V1.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEVER 0 — gemini-2.5-pro rejects a zero thinking budget with an HTTP 400 (Pro cannot have
 * thinking disabled). The floor is low but strictly above zero.
