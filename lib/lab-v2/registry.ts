/**
 * lib/lab-v2/registry.ts — the fifteen round-1 tools and their metadata
 * (LAB-MCP-V2-PRD-v1.0 §8, §8.1).
 *
 * ONE REGISTRY, NOT A FLAT LIST. V1's failure mode was `LAB_TOOLS`: an array of name +
 * description + inputSchema with no permission, no side-effect class and no cost class,
 * so every caller saw every tool and authorisation was whatever each handler remembered
 * to check. Here each tool declares its scopes, its effect and its cost, the endpoint
 * filters `tools/list` by them, and `tools/call` re-checks on every invocation.
 *
 * MCP annotations are GENERATED from `effect` (§3.2.4), never hand-written per tool. They
 * describe a tool to a client; they authorise nothing. Deriving them mechanically is what
 * makes "every tool's effect matches its annotations" a property the test can assert
 * rather than a list someone has to keep in sync.
