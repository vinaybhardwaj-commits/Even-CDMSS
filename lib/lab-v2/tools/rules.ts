/**
 * lib/lab-v2/tools/rules.ts — `rule_propose` and `rule_simulate`
 * (LAB-MCP-V2-PRD-v1.0 §17.7 C2, decisions 82 and 89).
 *
 * ⚠️ DECISION 82, SETTLED BY MEASUREMENT: LVC RULES NEVER REACH THE MODEL.
 *
 * `getLvcRules`' own comment says it (`lib/opd-note-audit.ts:106`): the LLM prompt does not load
 * them. `buildOpdAuditUser(caseText, citedContext)` takes two arguments and neither is a rule.
 * `stampLvcMetadata(out, lvcRules)` runs on the findings AFTER the reply and returns
 * `{...f, rule_ref, lvc_category}` — two fields, on findings already verdicted low-value.
 *
 * So a simulation is an EXACT REPLAY. Not "cheap enough": a rule cannot change the reply, so
 * replaying the stored reply is not an approximation of a fresh run — it is the same computation.
 * Zero model calls, and the live transport is wired to throw, so that is structural.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE MEASURABLE DELTA IS NARROW AND THE OUTPUT SAYS SO OUT LOUD. A rule can change `rule_ref`
 * and `lvc_category` and nothing else. It cannot add a finding, remove one, or move a verdict, a
 * confidence, the note-quality index or the band. A simulation that reported "3 audits changed"
 * without saying what changed would read as a score movement, which is exactly what it is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEITHER TOOL WRITES `lvc_*`. `rule_propose` reaches v1's own `lvc_propose` through v1's own
 * exported dispatcher `callLabTool` — no second export of a §14.3 function beyond decision 89's one
 * token, and no INSERT of our own. `rule_simulate` reads and replays. `c2-rules.test.ts` extends
 * decision 79's grep to `lvc_*` over this file and `releases/**` with exactly two exemptions.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND SEE `KEYWORDLESS_PROPOSAL` BELOW. A rule promoted end to end through v1's own path lands
 * with `keywords = '{}'` and can never match a finding. That is not a thing this round invented and
 * it is not a thing this round may fix; it is refused by name rather than reported as a zero.

/**
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE ONE THING IN THIS ROUND THAT IS NOT SETTLED, STATED WHERE IT BITES.
 *
 * A rule matches a finding through its KEYWORDS and through nothing else. `matchRule`
 * (`lib/opd-lvc-classify-core.ts`) is explicit: *"zero-keyword / empty-token rules never match"*,
 * and `getLvcRules` selects `id, keywords, category`.
 *
 * Neither v1 write supplies keywords:
 *   · `parseProposeArgs` (`lib/lvc-proposal-core.ts:143`) has no `keywords` and no `category` field
 *     — a caller cannot even express them;
 *   · `lvcPropose`'s INSERT names twelve columns of `lvc_recommendation_proposals` and neither is
 *     among them, though the table HAS both (`category text, keywords jsonb`);
 *   · `lvcRatify`'s promotion INSERT names fourteen columns of `lvc_recommendations` and neither is
 *     among them, though the table HAS both (`keywords TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}'`, migration 0005).
 *
 * So a rule proposed and promoted end to end through the ratified path lands active with an empty
 * keyword array and stamps nothing, for ever. Its simulation would be a guaranteed zero and its
 * release would put a no-op row into the governed rulebook.
 *
 * Closing it means editing `lib/mcp-tools.ts` past decision 89's single `export` token and editing
 * `lib/lvc-proposal-core.ts`, and the C2 file contract permits neither. So it is REFUSED BY NAME,
 * here and at `release_prepare`, and reported at the top of the round.
