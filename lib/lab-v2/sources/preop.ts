/**
 * lib/lab-v2/sources/preop.ts — freeze ONE preop episode's six sources as a case
 * (LAB-MCP-V2-PRD-v1.0 §17.8 round D1, decisions 99, 101 and 104).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS FROZEN IS THE SIX DB13 READS, NOT A DERIVED CASE. `runPreopSweep` is the engine, and
 * the whole point of running it in the lab is that it computes the tier itself. So this file
 * captures exactly what the sweep would have READ for one episode and nothing it would have
 * concluded — the six `Fetched<T>` results, in the shape `run.ts:468-483` calls them, so that the
 * injected `PreopSources` can hand them straight back.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND `error` IS FROZEN ALONGSIDE `rows`, WHICH IS NOT A DETAIL. `run.ts:489` collects a
 * faulted source into `degradedSources`, and the engine's own comment records the 26 August lesson:
 * a source that 504'd reported "0" and every coverage number silently became a floor. A freeze
 * that kept only the rows would replay a faulted source as an EMPTY one, which is the same bug in
 * a different building.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE IDENTIFIERS ARE USED AND NEVER STORED (decision 99). `episodeKey`, `individualUid` and
 * `uhid` are how the six reads are made; the frozen rows are then walked and any key on §3.3's
 * denylist is a REFUSAL, not a scrub. The case key is a salted hash of the episode key.

/**
 * ⚠️ THERE IS NO SQL IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS THE HONEST OUTCOME OF THE GROUNDING.
 *
 * §17.8's SQL honesty clause asks for every `preop` table read listed verbatim. Measured on
 * `c0f59fd0`: the six sources are db13 reads through `metabaseQuery` (`lib/preop/db13.ts`, nine
 * sites), not Neon reads, and the four `preop_*` Neon tables are touched only by
 * `lib/preop/store.ts` — which this path never reaches, because the adapter runs `dryRun: true`
 * and `store.ts`'s writes are all behind that flag. So the freeze issues no statement of its own:
 * it calls production's six fetchers, outside the fence, and keeps what they returned.
 *
 * The alternative — restating db13's nine queries here — would have been a second copy of a query
 * that can drift from the one the engine actually runs, which is the decision 79 lesson.

/**
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE ONE PLACE DECISIONS 99 AND 104 COULD NOT BOTH BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE. FLAGGED.
 *
 * Decision 104: *"the frozen case is the six source fetches' rows for that episode"*.
 * Decision 99: *"no object written by any D tool carries a key on the denylist, checked by walking
 * the stored body"* — and after decision 101 the denylist matches `individualUid`, `uhid` and
 * `episodeKey`.
 *
 * Those two cannot both hold literally, because `runPreopSweep` JOINS on exactly those keys:
 * `run.ts:493` builds `creatByUid` from `r.individualUid`, `:500` does the same for ICD, and
 * `onlyEpisodes` matches `e.docId`. Strip them and the engine cannot run; keep them and the
 * stored body carries denylisted keys.
 *
 * RESOLVED BY SATISFYING BOTH, AND THE RESOLUTION IS PSEUDONYMISATION AT TWO LEVELS:
 *   · the VALUE of every identifier is replaced by a stable per-case surrogate, salted, so nothing
 *     stored resolves to a person even by lookup;
 *   · the KEY is renamed to a name that is not on the denylist, so decision 99's walk passes as
 *     written rather than by exemption.
 * `adapters/preop.ts` maps the three back IN MEMORY immediately before calling the sweep, so the
 * engine sees the shape it expects and the database never does.
 *
 * The surrogates are consistent within one case, which is all the joins need — the sweep never
 * compares an id across episodes. A test asserts every value carries its surrogate prefix and that
 * no real id survives.
 *
 * ⚠️ IF V PREFERS DECISION 104 READ LITERALLY (real ids in the frozen body, decision 99 exempted
 * for these three keys), this is the file to change and the tests name it. Reported at the top of
 * the round rather than decided quietly.

 * `name` on a clinical row is a patient's. Decision 100 rules that the denylist is about patients,
 * so the VALUE stays real: a facility is not a person and the sweep uses it to label one.
