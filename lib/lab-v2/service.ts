/**
 * lib/lab-v2/service.ts — the fifteen tool handlers (LAB-MCP-V2-PRD-v1.0 §8.1).
 *
 * ONE DISPATCH PATH FOR EVERY TOOL, and it does the same four things in the same order
 * every time: re-check the scope, validate the input, run the handler, validate the
 * output. Nothing is left to a handler's memory.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SCOPE CHECK IS HERE, NOT ONLY IN `tools/list`. Visibility is a usability feature;
 * authorisation is this line. A principal that guesses the name of a tool it cannot see
 * gets SCOPE_DENIED — explicitly NOT "unknown tool" (§3.2.2), because a truthful denial
 * is a smaller leak than a lie a caller can distinguish by timing anyway.
 *
 * ⚠️ INPUT VALIDATION IS EXPLICIT HERE rather than delegated to the SDK. The MCP SDK is
 * given a JSON Schema through the bridge in lib/mcp-v2/schema-bridge.ts and may or may
 * not enforce it depending on how a client calls; §8's "inputs are validated at dispatch"
 * has to be true regardless, so the Zod schema is applied here where it cannot be skipped.

     * with a finer instrument — `production_read` plus a principal on
