/**
 * lib/stewardship-ops-core.ts — the consult-ops pane's PURE half
 * (CDMSS-STEWARDSHIP-MS-AGENT-KICKOFF-v2-29-AUG-2026, A4 / A7–A10; spec §4 D-ops-*).
 *
 * No DB, no clock, no next/*. Everything here takes what it needs as an argument.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE THREE RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE STRUCTURAL, rather than to write down and hope.
 *
 * 1. OPS IS NOT A RANK (D-ops-not-rank). Wait, no-show, Rx-share, CSAT and TC adherence are not
 *    skill artefacts. They never sort the named-clinician leaderboard, never join NQI / CVI / open
 *    dangerous in a composite, and never write `physician_standing`. `sortBoardRows` lives in
 *    lib/stewardship-danger-core.ts and takes three fields; nothing in this file is one of them, and
 *    nothing here exports a comparator.
 *
 * 2. EVERY METRIC CARRIES ITS DENOMINATOR (acceptance #20). A rate is a `Rate`, and a `Rate` cannot
 *    be constructed without an `of`. `rate()` returns null for a zero denominator rather than a
 *    zero, because "0% of nothing" and "0% of four hundred" are different statements and only one of
 *    them is about a clinician.
 *
 * 3. A DECK-BASIS FIGURE NEVER TRAVELS ALONE (A7 / A8 / A10, the deck-basis rule). It is modelled as
 *    a FIELD OF its primary, not as a sibling: `TwoBasis` has `primary` and `deck`, so there is no
 *    shape in which a deck number can be read without the primary having been read first. It sorts
 *    nothing and feeds nothing.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * THE THREE GRAINS STAY THREE (D-ops-grain). A calendar BOOKING is not a Chart CONSULT is not an
 * audited NOTE. They have three different denominators and this file never lets one stand in for
 * another: `OpsRow` carries all three counts and every rate names which one it is over.
