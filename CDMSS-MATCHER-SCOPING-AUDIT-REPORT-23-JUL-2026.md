# Deterministic Matcher Scoping Audit — Report

**Date:** 23 July 2026 · **Engine:** `opd-note-audit/0.81.10` · **HEAD:** `d098917` (unchanged) · **Gate:** 1299/1299
**Status:** AUDIT ONLY — read-only. No code/data/engine changes. Live counts over engines 0.81.8 + 0.81.9 + 0.81.10 (`app_source=standalone`, `excluded_reason IS NULL`). **HARD HALT** — V approves a fix sequence; fixes are separate kickoffs.

> **Method note on live counts:** stored rows pre-date the 0.81.10 relabel, so `signal_type` under-reports the checks that used to collapse into `low_value_care` (interaction-major, duplicate, dose-ceiling). All per-check counts below are by **subject prefix**, which is stable across the collapse — the honest live count of what each check actually emitted.

---

## 0. Headline

- **17 checks** audited across **9 files**. **2 load-bearing files were NOT in the §2 starting list** — `lib/formulary.ts` and `lib/formulary-match-core.ts`, the data-enrichment/matcher layer where **both the worst (semantic LASA) and the highest-leverage (structural form-drop) defects live.** Reviewing only the named emitter files would have missed both.
- **The LASA redundancy number (§4): 33% overlap / 67% unique — LASA is NOT largely redundant.** But the 67% "unique" content is dominated by clinically-legitimate co-prescription being penalised and by real duplication that belongs to a fixed dedup check; **none of the 88 are actual name confusables.** Evidence in §5; the (a)/(b)/(c) decision is teed up for V, not chosen.
- **One worst live scoring defect:** `lasa_pair`, 88 scoring findings, semantic + mechanical. It **cannot be fixed by tightening its comparison** — the data doesn't mean what the check claims.

## 1. Full per-check table (§3)

CLAIM = what the finding asserts · DATA = source + what it actually encodes · UNIT = comparison mechanic · live = subject-based count over 0.81.8/9/10.

## 2. Ranked defect list — by LIVE SCORING IMPACT

| rank | check | axis | live | scoring | remedy class |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| **1** | **`lasa_pair`** | **SEMANTIC** (data = same-class alternatives, not confusables) + mechanical (bidirectional substring) | **88** | **YES** | **re-label / re-source / delete — V's call (§5).** Cannot be repaired by tightening the comparison; the claim and the data disagree at the source. |
| **2** | **`drug_interaction`** | mechanical (unanchored `.includes` in tag-assignment + curated leg; truncated keys) | **348** | **YES** | **tighten comparison** (word-boundary/exact on the curated leg + tag keywords). **Measured live false-fire appears low** — the tag-rule *firing* is clean set-membership; the risk is upstream in assignment. Sample before spending. |
| **3** | **`duplicate_prescription`** | mechanical (exact-string; misses mono vs same-molecule FDC) | **43** | **YES** | **broaden comparison to molecule-level.** Would also absorb the 5 antidiabetic mono+FDC pairs currently mislabelled by LASA. |
| **4** | `dose_ceiling_exceeded` / `dose_ceiling_sos` | mechanical-minor (`medMolecules` multi-word tokens) | 27 + 80 | YES | tighten `medMolecules` tokenisation. Low impact — the checks are cited and mostly sound. |
| **5** | `high_alert_medication` | **SEMANTIC** (`high_risk` ≠ ISMP list) + structural (oral vs IV) | 139 | **no (info)** | **re-source** `high_risk` to ISMP + **plumb `form`/route**. Visible-wrong (§11.2 glucosamine ×14, oral MgSO4 ×10) but **informational → zero scoring impact**, so ranked below scoring defects. |
| — | `schedule_x` | data/coverage (0 fires) | 0 | info | investigate: dead check or formulary `schedule_dc` never carries `X`. |

**Structural (form-drop) is cross-cutting, not a single row:** `data/formulary-2026.json` carries `form`, but the enrichment (`lib/formulary.ts:45-63`) and `FormularyMatch` (`formulary-match-core.ts:160-172`) drop it, so **no matcher can be form-aware.** This is the single highest-leverage fix — it unblocks form-awareness for `lasa_pair`, `duplicate_*`, `high_alert`, and `banned_fdc` (cdsco-441) simultaneously. It is enabling plumbing; each consumer then changes separately.

## 3. Clean list — checks confirmed correctly scoped

- **`incomplete_dosing`** — well-guarded; exemptions for cosmetic/nutraceutical/unresolved lines; route inferred from the drug name (not the dropped formulary `form`, but adequate).
- **`resp_xanthine`, `antihist_montelukast`, `decongestant_duration`** — molecule-set membership with anchored context guards (acute-URTI required, chronic-airways/ICD excluded). Correctly scoped.
- **`off_formulary`, `unverified_brand`** — informational coverage roll-ups; claim matches data.
- **`duplicate_molecule` (dose-aggregation)** — comparison is clean molecule-equality (one gap: misses mono+FDC, see §5), informational.
- **`banned_fdc`** — comparison is exact molecule-set equality with fail-safe-to-silence; correctly scoped, awaiting real data (route-scoping is the one open structural need).
- **The DDI tag-rule *firing* leg** — clean set-membership over a 18-tag universe; the defect is only in tag *assignment* and the curated leg.

## 4. The LASA redundancy measurement (§6c) — plainly

**Over the 87 notes carrying a `lasa_pair` finding (88 findings):**

| overlap test | result |
|---|---|
| same drug pair also caught by `duplicate_molecule` / `duplicate_prescription` | 15 / 88 (**17.0%**) |
| same drug pair also caught by `drug_interaction` (same-class → a DDI rule) | 20 / 88 (**22.7%**) |
| same drug pair caught by **any** of {dup_molecule, dup_prescription, DDI, LVC therapeutic_duplication} | **29 / 88 (33.0%)** |

**LASA is NOT largely redundant — 67% (59/88) is unique.** So deletion does not win on redundancy grounds alone. **But the unique 67%, categorised, is the real story:**

| category of the 59 unique | n | nature |
|---|---:|---|
| azole antifungals (keto/fluco/itraconazole) | 23 | usually **topical + systemic for different sites** (skin vs oral/nail) — legitimate; the dropped `form`/route would clear most |
| paracetamol + ibuprofen | 7 | **standard multimodal analgesia** — legitimate co-prescription |
| antidiabetic mono + FDC (e.g. metformin & glimepiride+metformin) | 5 | **real molecule duplication** that `duplicate_molecule` MISSED — belongs to a fixed dedup, not LASA |
| progestogens (dydrogesterone & progesterone) | 4 | same-class overlap — a genuine signal, mislabelled |
| **vaccine co-administration** (pneumococcal + influenza) | 4 | **guideline-RECOMMENDED** — penalising correct care (a false flag, not a mislabel) |
| antihistamines (fexofenadine & desloratadine) | 4 | same-class overlap — genuine signal, mislabelled |
| other same-class / alternative | 12 | mixed |

**Zero of the 88 are actual look-alike/sound-alike name confusables.** The 67% "unique" volume is dominated by (i) clinically legitimate combinations penalised as errors (≥11: para+ibuprofen, vaccines, most topical+systemic azoles) and (ii) real duplication owned by a fixed dedup (5). The genuinely-novel-and-valid signal (same-class therapeutic overlap actually worth flagging — antihistamines, progestogens, some azoles) is a **minority**.

**Evidence for each of V's three futures (not choosing):**
- **(a) Re-label** to "same-class / therapeutic-alternative overlap": the data supports the label, but the check would **still over-fire** on para+ibuprofen, co-administered vaccines, and topical+systemic azoles. Viable **only with route/form-awareness (the §2 structural fix) + a legitimacy allow-list** — otherwise it trades a mislabelled penalty for a correctly-labelled wrong penalty.
- **(b) Re-source** with ISMP Confused Drug Names (~150 pairs): makes it a real LASA check, but **fires ≈0 in this OPD population** (none of the current 88 are confusables). High effort, near-zero yield here.
- **(c) Delete**: loses 67% of *volume* but little *validated* signal — the unique content is mostly false positives + duplication that belongs elsewhere. **Cheapest; resolves the worst live scoring defect with no data to source.** Caveat: first re-home the 5 antidiabetic mono+FDC real-duplications into a fixed `duplicate_prescription` (they are true positives LASA is accidentally covering).

## 5. Recommended fix sequence (V approves; score-affecting flagged)

1. **LASA decision (a/b/c)** — *score-affecting (88).* Highest live scoring impact and it gates all LASA spend. **Needs the Signal-Type-Collapse dry-run + canary gate.** If (a) or a partial (c), sequence the structural fix (2) first so it can be route/form-aware.
2. **Structural: plumb `form` through enrichment** — *enabling; not score-affecting by itself.* One change (`FormularyRow` + `enrichOpdMeds` + `FormularyMatch` carry `form`/normalised route). Unblocks form-awareness for LASA, duplicate_*, high_alert, banned_fdc. Each *consumer* that then starts gating on form is its own score-affecting fix with a dry run.
3. **`duplicate_prescription` → molecule-level** — *score-affecting (43).* Catches mono+FDC; absorbs the 5 LASA antidiabetic cases. Dry-run + canary.
4. **`drug_interaction` comparison tightening** — *score-affecting (348), but sample the live false-fire rate first* — the firing leg is clean, so the true defect volume may be small. Word-boundary the curated leg (ddi.ts:40) and tag keywords (ddi-tags:20); review truncated keys. Dry-run + canary.
5. **`high_alert_medication` re-source + form-plumb** — *NOT score-affecting (informational).* Fixes the visible §11.2 defects (glucosamine+KCl, oral MgSO4) — no citations per the citations-PRD §11.2. Can ship without a scoring dry run.
6. **`dose` `medMolecules` tokenisation + `schedule_x` zero-fire investigation** — minor/diagnostic.

Score-affecting fixes (1, 3, 4, and any form-gating consumer of 2) inherit the dry-run + permanent-canary discipline from the Signal-Type-Collapse build (PRD §6/§5.5).

## 6. Things that escaped the claim/data/unit frame (§7.3)

The frame is a per-check hypothesis; these are real findings it does not capture:
1. **A false-negative in one check surfacing as a false-positive label in another.** `duplicate_molecule`/`duplicate_prescription` MISS metformin mono+FDC (exact-string/molecule gap); LASA then "catches" those 5 pairs under the wrong label. No single-check row shows this — it is a cross-check interaction. Fixing dedup both removes 5 LASA false labels *and* adds 5 correct duplication findings.
2. **A check that penalises guideline-recommended care.** LASA fires on pneumococcal + influenza vaccine co-administration (4 notes) — not a mislabel, an actively wrong penalty on correct practice. Severity beyond "mismatch."
3. **A check with zero live findings** (`schedule_x`) — the frame assumes a check fires. A check that never fires is either dead code or a silent data gap (formulary `schedule_dc` may never carry `X`); either way it is an audit finding.
4. **A visibly-wrong check that the scoring-impact ranking hides.** `high_alert_medication` is semantically broken (`high_risk` ≠ ISMP) but *informational*, so it ranks last by scoring impact despite being the most-cited "obviously wrong" cluster. Ranking by live scoring impact is correct for prioritisation but must not be read as "least wrong."
5. **A new scoring check can silently COLLIDE with an existing check's deliberate policy** (added 23 Jul, from the Stage 2 dry run — a NEW failure class, not claim/data/unit). This is not one check being internally wrong; it is **two checks disagreeing about what deserves a penalty.** Concretely: `duplicate_molecule` (dose-aggregation) deliberately keeps within-ceiling same-molecule duplication *informational* (worth awareness, not a penalty). The Stage 2 remedy for the dedup gap, taken literally as "molecule-subset → scoring `duplicate_prescription`", OVERRODE that policy for 82 notes — re-scoring as penalties the exact population dose-aggregation chose not to penalise (paracetamol-dominated). The per-check table structurally cannot surface this: every row characterises ONE check in isolation, so a policy contradiction that only exists *between* two checks is invisible to it. **Lesson: before adding a scoring check, enumerate what already fires on the same clinical event and whether it deliberately chose NOT to penalise — a "gap" may be a policy, not an omission.** (This is why Stage 2's dedup was rejected at dry run and reworked dose-gated; see CDMSS-MATCHER-STAGE2-DRYRUN-REPORT.)

## 7. Provenance
- **Checks audited:** 17, across 9 files. **Not in the §2 starting list:** `lib/formulary.ts` + `lib/formulary-match-core.ts` (the data-enrichment/matcher layer — the LASA semantic defect and the `form`-drop both live here). Confirmed the §2 list was incomplete exactly where the worst defects are.
- **Data opened, not assumed:** `data/formulary-2026.json` (`lasa` = same-class alternatives, `form` present-but-dropped, `high_risk` ⊋ ISMP), `data/dose-limits.json` (10 cited molecules), `data/cdsco-banned-fdc.json` (0 entries).
- Read-only. Nothing written to any table or file. **HEAD unchanged at `d098917`.** Green gate 1299/1299. Measurement harnesses live in the session scratchpad (gitignored, write nothing).
- **HARD HALT.** V approves the fix sequence; each fix is a separate kickoff.
