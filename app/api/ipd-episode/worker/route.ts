/**
 * 800 s, matching app/api/ipd-audit/worker/route.ts. THE ARITHMETIC BELOW IS MEASURED, NOT
 * ESTIMATED, and it replaces a set of guesses that were wrong in the dangerous direction.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THE OLD COMMENT SAID, AND WHAT IT COST. It claimed "~520 s worst case per episode" from
 * an invented ~25 s per checkpoint. On 2026-09-03 IPNO-416 (LOS 3, 5 checkpoints, 269 billing
 * rows, 17 labs) hit FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT at the 800 s cap and left NO audit row and NO
 * skip row — the episode vanished. The stale number had silently capped which episodes this engine
 * could audit, and nothing re-derived it when round 8 raised max_tokens from 3000 to 8000, which
 * made every checkpoint response longer and therefore slower to generate.
 *
 * MEASURED, same deployment, same day:
 *
 *   IP-1313   LOS 0   2 checkpoints    ~60 billing rows    156 s   completed
 *   IP-1286   LOS 2   4 checkpoints   ~204 billing rows    227 s   completed
 *   IPNO-416  LOS 3   5 checkpoints   ~269 billing rows   >800 s   TIMED OUT
 *
 * One extra checkpoint cannot cost 3.5×, so the driver is EVENT VOLUME, not checkpoint count:
 * every checkpoint re-rendered the entire order stream, making the prompt cost O(checkpoints ×
 * events) — quadratic in an episode's size.
 *
 * TWO CHANGES ADDRESS IT, and the ceiling must be re-derived after either one moves:
 *   · checkpoints now run 3 AT A TIME (they are independent by construction), so checkpoint wall
 *     time is roughly ceil(n/3) × the slowest one rather than the sum;
 *   · the PROMPTS read a rolled-up order stream — pharmacy and consumable lines collapse to one
 *     line per day — so per-checkpoint prompt size stops scaling with billing volume. real_course
 *     and the resolver still see every event.
 *
 * THE CEILING, STATED IN THE UNITS THAT ACTUALLY BIND:
 *   · checkpoints: 8 is the maximum the plan can produce (7 daily + 1 episode, decision 24).
 *     At 3-way concurrency that is 3 waves.
 *   · events: the prompt-side count, not the assembled count. `prompt_events` and
 *     `assembled_events` are both recorded on every audit row; if prompt_events climbs back above
 *     ~150 for a large episode, this arithmetic needs redoing before the next cohort run.
 *   · the three judge passes remain STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL and are not bounded by any of this.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A TIMEOUT IS NO LONGER SILENT. An `in_progress` skip row is written before the model work
 * starts and survives the invocation dying, so an episode that vanished mid-flight is visible in
 * the data and retryable once the marker goes stale.
 *
 * ⚠️ maxDuration, max, the concurrency and the leg count are coupled. Changing any one without
 * redoing the measurements above is how this route ended up in a box it could not fit.

/**
 * The soft lock. `app_settings` key `ipd_episode_lock`, written at the start of a tick and released
 * in `finally`, so the TTL only decides what happens when a tick DIES without releasing.
 *
 * ⚠️ ITS OWN TTL, AND THE ARITHMETIC IS THE WHOLE REASON. The IPD module's shared helper
 * (lib/mini-backfill's `lockHeld` / MB_LOCK_TTL_MS) uses 210 s, sized for a tick that audits two
 * OPD notes inside a 300 s function cap. THIS route's box is 800 s and one episode can legitimately
 * run past 400 s (and IPNO-416 ran past 800) — so a shared 210 s TTL declared a perfectly healthy
 * tick dead at the four-minute mark
 * and let a second tick start beside it. Two ticks each holding three Opus calls is exactly the
 * request storm the IPD discharge worker's header documents at length.
 *
 * 780 s sits just under the 800 s box: long enough that no tick which is still inside its own
 * invocation is ever called stale, short enough that a crashed tick's lock clears before the next
 * cadence rather than wedging the worker until someone clears the key by hand.
 *
 * The lock is advisory, not a queue. If it ever were bypassed, the (encounter_id, engine_version)
 * unique index still makes a duplicate audit an UPSERT of the same row — never a second one.
