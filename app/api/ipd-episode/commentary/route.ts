/**
 * ON-DEMAND COMMENTARY — PRD decision 35 (V, 2026-09-03), amending decision 2.
 *
 * Pass B used to be stage 6 of the audit pipeline. It cost 107 s of IPNO-416's 314 s for output
 * that scores nothing, failed on both of the last two episodes, and is only ever read by someone
 * who has drilled into one episode. So the pipeline now ends at the fidelity pass and this route
 * generates the commentary the first time a detail page is opened, caching it to the row.
 *
 * The three properties this route must have, and where each is enforced:
 *   idempotent  — `saveCommentary` writes under `WHERE commentary IS NULL`, so two concurrent page
 *                 opens cannot produce two different commentaries; the loser reports `already`.
 *                 A row that already has one never reaches the model at all (the early return).
 *   admin-gated — the same ADMIN_TOKEN / admin-session pair as every other admin route here.
 *   never fatal — a failure returns 200 with `commentary: null` and a reason. A NULL commentary is
 *                 a normal state of a complete, scorable episode (decision 35), so a failure here
 *                 must not read to the caller as a broken episode.
 *
 * ⚠️ BLINDING IS NOT AT STAKE HERE and must not be re-argued into one. Pass B is the outcome-AWARE
 * pass by design (§3.6): it is the only one that may read how the admission ended. What it may not
 * do is invent findings, and that is enforced where it always was — `validateCommentary` against
 * the finding ids, below.
