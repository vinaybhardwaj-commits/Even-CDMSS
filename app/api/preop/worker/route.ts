// The rails are bounded BEFORE they start, not trimmed after they overrun. Three bounds,

// commit:
//   PREOP_LLM_BUDGET_MS             180,000 ms  a leg is begun only if its own ceiling
//                                               still fits inside what is left of this
//   PREOP_EXTRACT_MAX_PER_TICK            8     × PREOP_EXTRACT_BUDGET_MS   60,000 ms
//   PREOP_NARRATIVE_MAX_PER_TICK          3     × PREOP_NARRATIVE_BUDGET_MS 80,000 ms
// The caps alone would allow 8×60 + 3×80 = 720,000 ms, which is why the BUDGET rather
// than the caps is the binding constraint: the box check refuses the leg that would not
// fit, so the worst case is 180,000 ms of model time plus the slow deterministic tick —
// 235,383 ms against a 300,000 ms box. PASS, with the caps as the pacing rule and the
// budget as the wall.
//
// And the model term, like the SQL one, shrinks as the board settles: an extraction runs
// only when the SOURCE TEXT changed and a narrative only when the SNAPSHOT FINGERPRINT
// moved, so a board that has stopped moving makes zero calls on both rails. Measured, not
// assumed — every tick reports `rails.extraction.called` and `rails.narrative.called`.
//
// The same is true of the writes: an 'unchanged' episode makes ONE Neon read and zero
// writes. The scaling term is the per-episode round trip and the episode query
// caps at 500 rows, so the worst case is ~26× today's 19 — still inside the box against
// the measured per-episode cost, and the 55 s outlier says the real risk is Metabase
// latency rather than episode count. If the upcoming window ever approaches the 500-row
// cap, redo this arithmetic in the same commit that raises it.

/**
 * Behaviour per tick: ONE deterministic sweep. Detect every upcoming, non-cancelled
 * surgical episode; assemble its inputs from the booking form, the member's OPD ICD
 * codes, the Eka creatinine and the KareXpert PAC report reached through the UHID
 * bridge; recompute the snapshot; write it through the versions rail idempotently on
 * (episode_key, PREOP_ENGINE_VERSION).
 *
 * A second tick over unchanged evidence writes NOTHING — no finding row, no version
 * row — because the snapshot fingerprint is identical and the store short-circuits on
 * it. That is the B2 idempotency gate, and it is measurable by row counts rather than
 * by argument.
 *
 *   ?dry_run=1     → compute and report the tally, write nothing (the pre-migration probe)
 *   ?horizon=<n>   → look n days ahead instead of the default 60
 *   ?rails=extract,narrative
 *                  → MEASURE a rail without committing to it. Forces the named rails on
 *                    for this tick only. It IMPLIES dry_run and the implication is
 *                    enforced here, not documented: a forced rail may never write. This
 *                    exists because "flag-on over the golden set" is a gate, and the only
 *                    honest way to meet it before V flips a production flag is a tick that
 *                    runs the real provider path and stores nothing. `rails=none` forces
 *                    both OFF, for the flag-off arm of the same comparison.
 *   ?sample=1      → return the per-episode detail the B7 validation pack is built from:
 *                    each episode's tier, instrument bounds, extraction record with its
 *                    verbatim spans, and narrative. Rails-probe only — it is refused on a
 *                    tick that is allowed to write, so the heavy payload can never be
 *                    produced by the cron.
