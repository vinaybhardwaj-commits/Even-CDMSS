/**
 * app/api/admin/telemetry-overhead/route.ts — the real-database overhead measurement (addendum v4).
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS ROUTE IS TEMPORARY AND IS OWED A DELETION. It exists to take one measurement that a
 * stubbed harness cannot take, from a Vercel Preview against a NON-PRODUCTION Neon branch. Guard 2
 * below is a hard expiry, and it is the ONLY enforcement that this file goes away: nothing in CI
 * enumerates routes, so a note in a report is not a mechanism. After the expiry every AUTHENTICATED
 * request is 410, whatever else is configured — which is true only because the expiry runs second.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. PRD v2.1 line 267 requires numeric overhead guardrails before a canary;
 * kickoff D18 line 1032 forbids deploying to measure and confines measurement to a local or test
 * database. Both cannot hold, because D18's method excludes the term that decides the acceptance
 * criterion — the Mumbai-to-Singapore round trip. Amendment 1, signed by V before this pass, lifts
 * D18's prohibition FOR PREVIEW ONLY and leaves the prohibition on the production database standing
 * without exception. Guard 5 is that prohibition's mechanism rather than its promise.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FIVE GUARDS RUN IN THIS ORDER AND ALL FIVE MUST PASS. Each is proven by a child-process
 * case in `lib/__tests__/telemetry-overhead-guard.test.ts`; a guard that exists only in source is
 * not a guard.
 *
 *   1. admin           `requireAdmin` ALONE — no `isAdminUnlocked()` clause
 *   2. expiry          hard UTC date, 410 after it
 *   3. preview         VERCEL_ENV === 'preview' AND VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF === 'exp/rerank-telemetry'
 *   4. armed           CDMSS_OVERHEAD_MEASURE === '1'
 *   5. database identity   NOT the forbidden endpoint, AND equal to CDMSS_OVERHEAD_DB_ENDPOINT
 *
 * ⚠️ EXPIRY RUNS SECOND, NOT FIFTH (addendum v5 §9.1). Running it last made "after the expiry every
 * request is 410" false: anything failing an earlier guard got a 403 instead, so the deadline did
 * not mean what the report said it meant. Second is the first position where it can.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING HERE EVER LOGS, ECHOES OR RETURNS ANY PART OF `DATABASE_URL`, including inside an
 * error. Guard 5 compares one label and reports one word.

    // ⚠️ TWO DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS FROM THE MIGRATION ROUTE'S STOP RULE, AND THEIR REASONS.
    //
    // 1. That route returns 409 when the table exists WITH ROWS, because it would otherwise replace
    //    a CHECK constraint underneath legacy rows. Here, a second invocation ALWAYS finds rows —
    //    its own, from the previous cell — and §4 requires one cell per invocation, so a literal 409
    //    would make the matrix unreachable after the first call. Instead the decision is taken on
    //    EXISTENCE alone: absent ⇒ create, present ⇒ skip the DDL entirely. That is strictly safer
    //    than the migration route, because on the present branch no constraint is touched at all.
    //
    // 2. THE EMPTINESS COUNT IS GONE, AND NOT BECAUSE IT WAS INCONVENIENT.
    //    `lib/__tests__/telemetry-non-exposure.test.ts` fails on any `FROM <telemetry table>` in a
    //    file outside its ALLOWED set, and that test file is NOT on addendum v4 §6's contract, so it
    //    cannot be extended here. The two ways to keep the count were to edit that allow-list, which
    //    §6 forbids, or to build the table name dynamically so the source-text scan cannot see it —
    //    which is evading a privacy control by obfuscation, and is worse than not having the number.
    //    So the route reads NOTHING from the three telemetry tables. `to_regclass` asks the catalog

    // The first version returned `message.slice(0, 200)`, and that leaks the database password.
    // When `DATABASE_URL` fails `new URL` but still satisfies guard 5's hand parse, `neon()` puts
    // the ENTIRE connection string into its throw. Measured against the real driver, two of the
    // three ordinary paste mistakes do it:
    //
    //   value still wrapped in quotes   →  'Connection string: "postgresql://u:PASSWORD@ep-….neon.tech/db"'
    //   a leading `psql `               →  'Connection string: psql postgresql://u:PASSWORD@ep-….neon.tech/db'
    //   a dropped `postgresql://`       →  a format template with no user data — this one does NOT leak
    //
    // 200 characters is more than enough for user, password and host. `lib/admin-gate.ts` returns
    // null when ADMIN_TOKEN is unset, so this route may be open, which makes it a disclosure to
    // anyone who can reach the URL.
    //
    // `name` is the constructor name — 'Error', 'NeonDbError' — and never carries operator input. It
    // is the only thing taken from `e`, and the guard test asserts the whole body against every
    // substring of the connection string, in both the response and the child's stdout and stderr.
