/**
 * app/api/admin/lvc-judge-aa/route.ts — LVC applicability-judge A/A harness.
 * DETERMINISM-TRIO PRD v1.0 §4 (D-4: MEASURE ONLY), 8 Aug 2026.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. For each sampled note it assembles the judge context ONCE through the production
 * pipeline (lib/lvc.ts `matchLowValueCare`), then runs that pipeline TWICE more with the recall
 * result PINNED to what the first pass produced — so both runs hand `defaultJudge` a byte-identical
 * context object at the production configuration (temperature 0.1, the same model resolution,
 * surface 'surface'). The two verdict sets and their comparison go to `lab_analyses` under
 * `experiment = 'lvc_judge_aa_r1'`.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It changes NOTHING on the production judge path: `defaultJudge`,
 * `JUDGE_SYSTEM`, `lib/lvc.ts` and `lib/lvc-core.ts` are untouched, and no threshold or floor is
 * read or written. Pinning the judge is a separate, later decision gated on this measurement
 * (§4.3 — V's, made on the report, not by this route).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE VERDICTS COME FROM THE TRACE. `matchLowValueCare` returns assembled FLAGS, not the
 * judge's raw verdicts (assembleFlags drops everything below the surface's confidence floor), and
 * `defaultJudge` is not exported. Reading `lvc_judge_verdicts` — the observability event the
 * pipeline already writes on every real /api/appropriateness call — is the only way to observe the
 * PRODUCTION judge without forking it, and a forked judge would measure a different function than
 * the one in question. Only that event kind is read, and only its (id, verdict, confidence) triples;
 * the payload is never stored. CONSEQUENCE, FLAGGED: each case writes 2 `appropriateness` traces,
 * exactly as two real order-checks would. No scoring table is touched — not opd_note_audits, not
 * appropriateness_runs. Results land in lab_analyses and nowhere else.
 *
 * BUDGET. ~2 judge calls per case, fired by the ORCHESTRATOR when this route is called — never by
 * CI and never by the nightly worker. Sequential (concurrency 1), stops cleanly at 250 s and
 * reports progress; call it again to resume, since uids already stored for the tag are skipped.
 *
 * EVERY SQL STRING IN THIS FILE IS INFERRED (the builder has no live DB) and is reproduced verbatim
 * in the build report for orchestrator validation. Fail-safe throughout: a failure returns a JSON
 * error body, never a 500 mid-batch, and never a partial junk row.
