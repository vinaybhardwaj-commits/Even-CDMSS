        body="Even Coach runs a multi-turn Socratic dialogue grounded in the same curated database that powers /ask and /ddx. You pick a topic or paste a case, then trade questions back and forth — the coach evaluates each of your replies, adapts difficulty in real time, and produces an end-of-session summary with concepts mastered, gaps, and a suggested next topic. The end summary is audited by a second model before you see it. Per-turn latency 8 – 25 s; full session typically 5 – 15 turns."
